    "This brush is just 2.5 inches long and 0.5 inches wide. So it is not really suited or well designed to serve as an electric shaver cleaning tool. Very disappointed and would not recomend it for that task, but might be useful for smaller electrical/battery powered items.",
    "This is not a gel. This is a cream. This is horrible grainy stuff. It does not have the same effect as the actual Gel Oragel, and it tastes AWFUL.. I will not ever be purchasing this again.",
    "I will never understand why a company would put menthol in a product that is applied to the face-- an area where the eyes are located. Firstly, there has been no science to back up using menthol in cleansers beyond providing the false notion of cleanliness people get from the \"tingling\" it gives as it irritates their skin. Secondly, it HURTS when gets near the delicate skin of the eye. This cleanser isn't even that great; so no need at all to suffer the eye burning. Shame on Burt's bees for using such garbage in a product.",
    "When I took this product out of the box I examined it, curious to what design differences set it apart from other electric shavers such that it wouldn't nick and cut one in the sensitive areas it is advertised for.  I couldn't discern any and after using it, and being cut twice (I stopped after the second time), I can tell you there are none.  Its just an electric shaver.  Nothing special or noteworthy other than the advertising.  Philips Norelco ought to be the subject of a class action suit for false advertising and personal injury.",
    "After using it 5 times already the scrubby side & the mesh side are already coming apart. I didn't use the scrubby side much because it's too rough. The mesh side does lather nice, but can be a bit rough on the skin as well. Also the surface area is small to work with & it's kind of awkward to use. I wanted to like this product, but it's overrated & I would say it's (not that the cost is gonna break the bank) overpriced for what it is. I'll just stick with using a wash cloth or I'll get a mesh pouf for 99.",
    "This product claims to be formaldehyde free and uses germaben II as a safe commonly used alternative. However, Germaben II is a preservative that is made up of several different parabens and GIVES ALL FORMALDEHYDE. [...] So, if you are buying this product based on the claim that it is a safer formaldehyde free alternative, I'd steer clear.",
    "Julie and I are both white teeth people. We brush regularly; see the dentist; and floss! One day, Thomas ran out of his Scope. Julie had been nursing her bottle of Total Care Listerine for nearly a year and was down to her last dose. We had unequal dinner. I added onion to my burger. It was obvious that I could use the Listerine more than Julie; willingly I uncapped the bottle. Wish and swish the vomit was supposed to work! What did I do to deserve this punishment? What ever I did I'm so sorry! Julie I will never do it again!\nJulie found complete solace with an immediate understanding that her year of sipping the rotten milk made her teeth stronger and her willpower apparently has no tarter and her enamel is stronger than mine; however, this stuff can not be recommended other than as part of a dental punishment regime.",
    "Like some other reviewers I am disappointed in the 7810XL. Maybe not poor by today's standards, but poor compared to what Norleco used to produce.  I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old 3605X. The 3605X was one of the cheapest cordless models at the time, but has performed well over the years. I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak. A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model. It was poor and returned it. This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL. Also thought it might help that is was made in Holland as opposed to the ones from China. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.\n\nThe biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X. Why does that matter? Ever tried to shave with a low battery? Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does. Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.\n\nI am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors. At this point I will probably return this one, too.",
    "Although this razor looks sleek and cool, it performs horribly. I have used it a couple times, and afterwards it's like I didn't even shave at all! I go over areas 5-6 times, and the hair is still there! It even managed to cut my skin while my hair stayed intact. I would not recommend this razor to anyone.",
    "The trimmer blows hairs into my eyes, and its design makes it very difficult to trim up close to my nose.  I would give this product negative stars if I could.",
    "The packing for this floss has gone down dramatically in the last year or two.  Was it because Crest bought them?  Some engineer tried to save a few pennies and the metal part now breaks off frequently or the top comes off.",
    "Has actually made my cuticles worse! They have never cracked so badly as they are now after having used this oil about 3 or 4 times.",
    "Wanted a head that rotated",
    "I do not like it and would like to return it!! How does one do that???",
    "Is falling apart with the first use. Very dissapointed",
    "This left my hair an ashy almost greenish color. The extra light by tints on nature worked better. I would stay away from this color unless you luke an ashy, greenish blond :(",
    "Very misleading title. Title clearly says 4 pack and only received 1. Thought I was getting a great deal for 4 of these but instead spent way too much just for 1.",
    "it is leaking only in 2 weeks of use and it was trashed in 3 months, what a disappointment and waste of money",
    "This works great for awhile...then  the adhesive wears very quickly. Then it doesn't work at all...only last about a month. I've purchased two...this will be the last. I'll come up w/something else.",
    "Very unimpressed.  Even as I was rinsing it out it did not felt like it had softened my hair. When it was dry, it was still very tangled and very dry. Useless. Save your money.",
    "I've been using this product for quite some time and I can't wait til it is gone.  I'll never buy it again.  It only pulls out some of the fine hairs, leaving the thick hair behind.  For the pain that one endures, one would expect a nice smooth, hairless area after pulling off the strip.  If you already bought the product or plan to buy it, be sure to purchase tweezers to complete the job.  In addition, the gel is messy and hard to manage; a real thick, hard ball - imagine honey that is kept past the expiration date.  Also, the strips of fabric fray at the edges, so those threads get stuck in the goo mess.  You can see from the other Nads links here at Amazon that other customers have had the same experience.",
    "The merchandise is excellent. However, I am only giving a one star because it took over 30 days to receive the item.",
    "This product is so strong I can use it again.",
    "This seller sent me the brunette color glaze instead of the clear one so I guess this review is about the colored glaze - I'm wondering if the clear one would have done a better job! I was mad enough that I got the wrong product, but nothing could have prepared me for the result! :(\n\nThe brunette color glaze version was a disaster - made my hair terribly dry and tangled!. I followed the instructions to a tee, so I'm really wondering how smtg like this can still be so heavily marketed when it can actually damage your hair that much.\n\nAfter that devastating experience, I did some research to try and find a glaze that would actually IMPROVE the appearance of my hair instead of worsening it (!) and tried the Sebastian's cellophane hair treatment - omg that was a life-saver!!\n\nI was absolutely thrilled to see that that product actually DOES coat your hair and gives it a silky feel and look.\n\nThe only thing is having to sit for 15 min with the hairdryer in your hand - but this is the only product that has returned my hair to a healthier look so to me, it's still worth the pain and the price - around 25$ per tube.\n\nI will be trying the Sebastian tinted version next - fingers crossed!",
    "I have used many electric shavers in the past and most were Norelco rotary shavers. This particular model is the worst of all of them. Its shave is barely adequate. I needed to go over the same area dozens and dozens of times to get a decent shave. Replacing the blade head didn't help. Even at this relatively low price, this shaver is not worth it. I recommend passing on it.",
    "Exacerbated burning where appliedd for 2 or 3 hours without relief from pain orr discomfort.",
    "Does not fit all keys.  Would not buy product again.  Wanted to use on a normal front door key but does not fit.  Supplier should describe and spec it better.",
    "I returned this product. I used it for at least 14 days and noticed no difference. I didn't feel like the pressure was strong enough to really do anything.  I also sometimes didn't start even when it was turned on and I had to start and stop it several times to start.",
    "I have used Norelco razors for years, so I looked forward to this top of the line new model. What a disappointment! The design is far out, way too far out! It gives a very poor shave and causes razor burn at the same time. I had thought that these two conditions were mutually exclusive, but Phillips has managed to put them both in this razor. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.\n\nI replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.\n\nIf I were Phillips, I would do what Ford did with the Edsel and withdraw it from the market before it damages their reputation any further.",
    "I just received this item today, was super excited. Opened the bix and the lid is broken:(  I haven't used it yet to give it more stars yet.",
    "Tore me up ,the blade is not a sharp blade at all. I would not recommend these. I will stick with feather or shark.",
    "I,ve owned electric razors for years and the Remington line really sucks. The initial cut and closeness is fine but the blade block metal is either four times as hard as the foil(screen)or the tolerance is too tight. This in turns eats or tears a hole in the screen every 3-4 weeks. At over $37.00 a replacement set this sucks big time. I've e-mailed their customer service and was told that excessive pressure causes premature wear and set me a 10% off coupon, sounds like marketing and engineering got a bonus for this design. Funny that my brothers does the same thing! Buy this poor design at the risk of slicing your face with no warning or emptying your wallet every four weeks. I'll stick with the Brauns fixed blades from now on. Their block last two years and the foil close to one.",
    "For me it i dosent work.",
    "I just bought this product and the dispenser doesn't function...Gillette is an old brand name and should be well passed this simple problem...I resent being taken over a few bucks. I won't use their products for a long time now.",
    "Worst blades ever had.  Nail clipper sharper than these blades.",
    "I returned it as the plug was not compatible with British sockets or adaptors. Very disappointed.",
    "I have been tanning for 3 years and this is the worst product I have ever used and I will never use it again",
    "Save yourself the money.. break a beer bottle and shave with the shards.",
    "Have not seen the growth with this product as I have with others.",
    "This looks like an \"As Seen on TV\" item. Mickey mouse construction which won't even attach to the wall. Don't waste your return postage money by buying this piece of *^#@,",
    "Smelled funny.  Couldn't use it, neither would my roommate.",
    "Didn't really help me!",
    "Pretty peeved. This is obviously a scam to get folks to pay organic price for the standard (thus cheaper) product. Both the item description AND the item image clearly state this is supposed to be organic. Been ripped off.",
    "This product and it's adjunct must have been thought up by marketing. It's useless for the cleaning required for a complex Braun shaver head.\nI threw the whole unit out after using it 3 times. My method of cleaning. 1- Remove the head. Brush out hair from shaver body. Clean head with a spray of hot water from the tap. Dry head with tissue followed by a hair dryer on max dry. Replace head and lube with Remington spray shaver lubricant.",
    "Like some of the other reviewers, my face turned very bright red and stung the first time I used this product. The negative effects occurred immediately upon applying it. I attempted to wash off the product to achieve some relief, but to no avail. After applying ice packs to my face for approximately 1.5 hours, the redness and burning sensation subsided. I would not recommend this product.",
    "They look super fake",
    "I received my waterpik but no tips. The description says 6 tips but the tip holder has none. So, I was not able to evaluate this product.",
    "I just placed an order for these as part of a larger order.  When I looked at my shopping cart I saw that not only does this item not qualify for SuperSaver shipping, but it is back ordered into April (over a month), and the shipping charges are over $11.00 on a $7.99 item.  At almost $19.00 and a months wait, no thank you.",
    "I returned the appliance because it wasn't the model I wanted and the on/off switch didn't work.  I wanted model 1570, but can't find it.",
    "My item arrived looking like it had already been used.",
    "These pads are nothing more than poorly die cut shapes with an \"adhesive\" back.  They have sharp edges that are uncomfortable and they are no more than 1 millimeter thick and are totally useless.  The adhesive is extremely weak.  A major dissapointment !",
    "The product smells fantastic.  It's a lighter version of Pinaud Clubman which has that classic barber shop fragrance.  The seller promised to deliver by April 01 but it arrived on the 3rd.  Upon opening the box a portion of the contents had already spilled out.  I would suggest taping the screw top cap to the bottle as well.",
    "I bought this for a present and the soap was so ugly I did not gift the soap. You could hardly recognize the moose. The company would have never sold the soap in a brick and mortar store. The soap did smell good. I should have just ordered more of the vanilla, best soap ever.",
    "I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND GOOD REVIEWS.  THIS PRODUCT IS USELESS.  IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO.  IT SEEMS TO BE \"WORKING PROPERLY.\"",
    "This product is not for men with thick hair.  I am not a hairy person by any means but what hair I do have is thick.  It's great that it's water resistant but that dosen't matter much if it dosen't cut the hair.  Everytime I take off the blue thingies the whole face comes off.  Poor quality all around.",
    "I have long fine hair on my back.\nThis shaver does not cut this hair.\nI rub it over my upper back and lower back as best as I can.  Very little hair is cut.  I've given up on using it.\n\nSince this product does not fulfill it's purpose I will stop this review here.  No biography necessary.",
    "This razor is very poor and not worth the money.  You would be better off buying a cheap throw-away razor than using this one.  Gillette's advertising is a complete ripoff.",
    "Clumpy makes eyelashes heavy and uncomfortable",
    "its no good. The wax is like taffy and doesnt come off of anything and it hardly holds to the hairs",
    "I bought this razor after reading about it on consumer reports and the reviews on amazon.  I have to guess that CR tested it for a day or so, and the positive reviewers here wrote their reviews after a week or less.  The \"microscreen\" is incredibly flimsy.  Within 3 weeks, mine developed a slit that grew a little every day.  The blades underneath contact your skin through the slit, and hack you up like Freddy Krueger.  Then you need to replace the microscreens at $20 each.  It's a good razor while the screen lasts, but if you need to replace it every month at $20/each, why bother?",
    "The first one I got stuck well and lasted 8 months.  I ordered another one for me and one for my daughter. Neither would stick from day one. I wouldnt recommend.  They need to refund.",
    "Useless.",
    "I love all things French Lavender as well as most products made in France, so this Pre de Provence Maison French Lavender Bath Salts should of been the perfect product for me.  Unfortunately it isn't!\n\nFirst of all, the cap to the bottle arrived dented in several places.  The bottle is plastic, it arrived totally unsealed both outside the bottle, as well as inside the bottle.\n\nMy main complaint is that this in no way smells like lavender to me, much less French Lavender.  Iam not sure what could of happened, but had I been able to smell this beforehand, I would of passed on ordering it.  It is a lovely shade of purple, if purples your thing, and you aren't as particular when it comes to scent like Iam.\n\nTo me lavender and specifically French Lavender should smell a certain way.  This doesn't!  French Lavender is my favorite scent, period.",
    "Misleading product title.  Only received one instead of a pack of four.",
    "I PURCHASE THAT ITEM `IT S COOL BUT IF YOU LOST OR BRAKE THE COMB THERE IS NO REPLECMENT YOU NEED TO BUY NEW THIS IT NOT THE WAY SHOULD BE I GUESS.",
    "This product was as dull as my 1 year old cutter block! Vendor was fantastic but I think he needs to review his supplier (from China).",
    "Didn't work for me",
    "I went to use the pink teqie trimmer and it was SO slow even my clients said it sounded like it was about to die which was totally embarrassing considering I'm a licensed professional hair stylist. And it had a hard time cutting thru the hair.. I'm so mad I paid for a defective item!!! It makes me weary to buy anything else on Amazon!",
    "This is a piece of junk.  Even with NOTHING in it, it wouldn't stay on the wall of the tub.  And I cleaned the wall, and then dried it so the suction cups would work their best.  I bought two of them and mounted them.  And in the middle of the night, they both ejected themselves off of the wall and into the tub -- making a truly horrible racket and waking us all up!  I tried the whole thing again the next day, but they did the same thing.  Remember, this is with NOTHING in them!  They can't even hold up their own weight, much less the added weight of toys!  Don't waste your money.",
    "Got two playsation batteries instead like really?? i waited like 2 weeks and come to find out they made a mastake with my package with play station batteries really? And then they told me to send them back and i had to pay 50 dollars to ship them right back .. THE WORST!!\n\n* if had the choice to put no stars, i would .",
    "This product is just as the title describes even when you follow the instructions written on the bottle. I ended up with redness and rashes on my body after utilization. For about four days, I couldn't take a shower without experiencing discomfort because the water would exacerbate the condition. I am never going to use Nair again until they create a proper formulation. People really and truly be aware of this product. I am going to order the Phillips Norelco Bodygroomer Pro BG 2040 ASAP!!!!",
    "Did not like it at all. A big waste of money, it's already broken.",
    "This is the new formula, not the original formula.",
    "I was unable to use it.  It remained a mass of tangles after several days of use.  It is a waste of money.",
    "not a great product waste of money",
    "Junk!",
    "Not at all effective. Waste of money",
    "not tough/rough enpough",
    "This stuff smells disgusting. Does not lather. Don't waste your time or money. .",
    "It's very hard to get the Tooth paste, I thought it was a good idea to get this to my 7 years old, unfortunately it was hard for her to use and the bad thing is that I ordered 6 of them.",
    "It DOES NOT stay attached to ANY surface what so ever. You have to go out and purchase 2 more suction cups for the product (IT DOES NOT COME WITH IT) and I can not find any suction cups to actually fit the slots it has for it.\n\nDO NOT BUY!!!",
    "this was suppose to be comparable to coco channels mystery 40.it is way to pink and way to sparkling. i have used this mystery 40 for two years it is perfect but can not find anything to compare with it.it has been discontinued so still looking.",
    "This thing barely cuts hair.  I bought it for trimmer around the ears and the back of the neck.  It is not a true 0 trimmer so it does not leave sharply cut lines.  I thought buying a plug-in would be better than all the rechargeable trimmers but it is probably worse.",
    "I thought I was ordering the 7810 XL, but what was shipped was not an XL, but a plain 7810. I had purchased a Norelco shaver several years ago, a 5845 XL, and have been pleased with it. I felt, after all this time, maybe Norelco had improved the shaver, so I ordered a new one. I was wrong. The old one, the Norelco 5845 XL, is superior to the new one. The only advantage of the 7810 is, it's quieter. I'm left wondering, if I had received the 7810 XL, which is what thought I was ordering, would it have been as good as my old razor. Now,of course, I'll always wonder.",
    "The bottle I bought fro Amazon has no expiration date and no production date.\nI have an old order that I got a year ago that has not expired yet and when I got new bottle the capsules have different color and they smell differently.\nI opened both caps and tasted and they were slightly different in taste.\nI called CHI's Enterprise and they told me that they are not going to stamp the date on the bottle unless they are asked from the seller to do so. On my question why the color and the smell of 2 bottles are different they had no idea.\nOrdering from them directly is expensive. They charge $9 even though they are 2 hour away from my location.\nI have no idea if I should use the new bottle since CHI's Enterprise is incompetent to explain why the product is different. I'm afraid that they also have no control what comes from China. They just packaging the product in Anaheim, CA.\nVery sad, I really wanted to trust that they are a good company.",
    "It arrived on time, but does not work. Don't waste your money!",
    "I does not work for me. It is not strong enough for my thick hair. I would have send it back but threw out the packaging.",
    "i bought this on march 30th from amazon. started using it straight away with the remington face saver powder. i was never that happy with the results (shaved everyday, minimum stubble) but persevered because i'd spent the money-also had nothing to compare it too. the noise of this thing is absolutely horrendous, i really think you could sustain hearing damage over a period of time. i stopped using it about 8 weeks ago-fed up with infernal racket & lack of a quality shave. since then i've now used a ten year old norelco, even that elderly worn out thing was like the difference between light & dark...i swear!! i've just ordered myself a new 7340 norelco & i'll update that in a few days/weeks & let people know how that's doing.",
    "They do not conform to your face. They do not cover your eyes. What's sad is they're made in the USA, the made in China ones preform as they are supposed to.  Do not buy these for indoor tanning.  They are not safe.",
    "It was too short and didn't hold much hair at all to heat",
    "I am amazed at all the rave reviews on this product and their shampoo. It did not detangle my twin girl's hair at all. They are two and have different types of hair. It left a weird film on it. I had to use a leave in conditioner in order to detangle their hair. Hugely disappointed and what a waste of money. Over the counter conditioner worked so much better than this. I can't believe I relied on all the great reviews on here about this. I would give it zero stars if I could.",
    "Did not feel any difference in my body",
    "Barely trims body hair.  Nowhere near other evaluations.",
    "I bought this to replace an ancient Norelco electric - plug in the wall type - before batteries type - which had razors that'd never been replaced in ten years' use. You would have thought I'd be overjoyed? I was when i found out the volume level of the motors in more modern devices is about 1/3rd that of the old ones. That's where the happiness ended. I was dubious about why you'd want a battery - I mean - the hell? Why make a device that will intentionally become 100% worthless within a few years instead of lasting perhaps as many as 20 if I wanted it to? Old electric shavers with ancient blades still work pretty good to my standard...\n\nAnyhow the deal breaker that made me stop using this sucker within 2 months and switch back? The mechanism to open it up and empty out the shavings inside is so idiotically designed that every time I would travel no matter how careful I was it would get popped open in my vanity bag and leak hair EVERYWHERE. Like putting a hair toothbrush in your mouth? Old shaver never did anything of the sort, and old shaver would never leak even if full of hair. I'm not used to this new age of emptying the hair constantly, I used to do it monthly or so.\n\n\"New\" technology, a huge step backwards.",
    "Would not stick on the wall and would not close at the bottom. I am disappointed that I chose to spend my money on this and by the time I got around to trying to set it up the box had been thrown away so I couldn't return it.",
    "Lipstick was not sealed and it does not swivel upward so essentially a rotten deal two times over!",
    "The design was nice and it was comfortable to hold but this shaver was so loud when I turned it on that our dog came running into the bathroom to see what the noise was all about.  It's unfortunate because I had read good reviews about this product. I didn't want to have to shave with earplugs, so I returned it to Remington for a refund. Remington was very good about honoring the terms of their warranty.",
    "Makes your hair feel awful and very dangled and dry!",
    "After only a couple uses the barrel disconnected from the handle and moved freely around.  Basically a waste of money",
    "I just hate this wax .... It smells so yuck and sticks to ur body even after two or three washes... my room becomes mess whenever i use it ..",
    "worst service ever, i order this thing and never got it, i was charge and i haven't got my money back",
    "Does not work. was does not harden and if you use the strips the was still sticks to your face.",
    "this product put lines in my hair. seriously. the 1/8\" blade is so flexible and second-rate that when applied to the scalp it bends in all different directions, allowing the cutting blades to get too close to the skin. the result? the side of my head looks like vanilla ice. pass on this.",
    "Didn't work at all... just made a mess.",
    "It can melted all over the other products I purchased",
    "This product is very disappointing.  The suction cups do not stay and the product itself does not stay together.  I am returning for a refund.",
    "Not a good product. It was a waste of money one was it was gone.",
    "Horrible allergic reaction, use alternative organic brands instead this is one to skip until thru remove the PDP it's not eorthbit",
    "This trimmer is a joke!\nFirst of all it's cordless and it takes a whole lot of energy to run those blades, but philips guys decided to make a brake through and added a vacuum system that helps to kill that already poor battery! Conclusion: either the accumulator should be improved or get rid of the vacuum!\nSecond, one cannot get a close cut! Min. length that you can get is 2.5 mm , so think twice if it's enough for you!\nThird, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality! It feels really cheap in one's hand. At first, I thought that it would be steel or some sort of a solid material, wroooong. Cheap plastic!\nHope it's helpful!",
    "Super cheap version of shower gloves. Get the ones at Bed Bath & Beyond for $3.99 instead - they are thicker and feel much better!",
    "Too tick, and my hair turns white/unhealthy after use. Am not trilled\nSure will not Buy again",
    "Can't stand the smell. I  hardly use it.",
    "This was a 5 star review created in my name.  Someone is hacking my reviews.  I have never bought this.",
    "Waste of money; smelled like vinegar all day, peeled skin off left it pink and sensitive. Still have ingrown hairs.. This is what my arm looks like after using product for a month.",
    "Very good shaver... for a few shaves. I bought my first unit on Christmas, had it replaced due to the battery problems similar to the ones reported in other reviews here. Second unit - same problem. My idea of a good shaver (and good product in general) doesn't include dealing with the customer service, and I've had too much of it with this shaver. I was offered a third unit - c'mon...I went for a refund, these guys need to admit that there is a design flow with these units and fix it rather than keep replacing the units. I have one word for them - recall",
    "This is not a review for the wilkinson blades themselves, which are awesome (5 stars). I selected to purchase 100 blades for $18.95. The title above said 50ct. If I had received 50 I would have been ok with it (cost a bit higher than local, but saved me a trip to the store); however, I received 10 blades for $14.54. They sell locally for around $1.25 for a 5 pack. Two dollars fifty is no where near $14.54 and since it isn't what I signed up for, Kay Beauty: I will absolutely be returning these.",
    "One of the devices is broken. It doesn't roll upwards.",
    "This razor only has 3 blades which makes it very rough.  Should have bought the 5 blade which is smoother.",
    "Doesn't work. As if I applied nothing. Will be returning",
    "Used maybe 4 times and it stopped working. I have always used this brand curling irons, etc. Had no problems.",
    "Poor quality. Does not shave close at all.  It was a total waste of money.  I will never buy this brand again.",
    "I have been wearing Shalimar for 50 years. This did not smell like Shalimar.",
    "I have owned two of these clippers / groomers - and I have to say - that they are a sheer waste of money and time -esp. if you have a decent amount of body hair. They don't really cut hair - there is more pulling than cutting. And it takes for ever to shave my chest hair - i have go over the same spot over 10 times to get a clean cut.

    "To be fair, I have not tried this replacement product, but I would recommend carefully checking out all the reviews here on Amazon.  One or two negative reviews can be expected with any high volume product, but this replacement foil seems to be a poor substitute. Given the high volume demand for the original, Braun should have had no reason to discontinue the original.  In fact, when I contacted them regarding their reasoning, they referred me to a vendor who supposedly still carried the original but in fact does not.",
    "I have been using this moisturizer for several years.  In the past I have loved it.  However they have changed the formula and make it more \"creamy\".  Well all that has done is made it very difficult to get out of the bottle because it is so thick and it doesn't go on the skin smoothly at all.  I would like the old formula back.  I will not be buying this product again.",

    "After having this product about 1 week i dropped it from approximately 10 inches.  I dented the weak \"titanium\" microscreen and had to order new ones at 30 dollars a piece.  I soon realized that I was running out of charge extremely fast and noticed that when i was plugging the unit in it was not charging (completely separate and unrelated to the 10 inch drop).  I would have to wiggle the charging plug back and forth several times before the charging light would come on.  Eventually after about 2 months this razor refused to charge and to the trash it went.  A month later my Remington haircutter also died, NOT IMPRESSSED.  I've had my less powerful Norelco electric razor for over 6 years and I've never had a problem.  Also the rubberized outside button is very cheap and could easily get torn or ripped, as for the \"titanium\" finish on the outside its just a cheap paint job. OVERALL i think im done with remington.",

It's not like a constant stream like you see in the commercials. Any pressure higher than 4 would cause the handle to shake and makes it hard to hold. Water also started leaking out from the handle. The water in the container won't last more than 10 seconds if you don't put it on the lowest pressure. The lower pressures don't even seem to make any difference..,might as well just throw some water in your mouth. For returns, they charge $10 and up. Overall, not worth it.",
    "These are awful. These clippers are so thick & awkward, that there is no way I would trust them to cut my nails!  They have the angle that I was looking for & need, but the edges are way too thick & uneven which makes it impossible to cut with & get right up against the nail. You'd probably get the nail & a huge chunk of skin along with it!  I have a pair that I bought years ago from a retail store that have become a little dull. I can't find them anywhere. I saw these & ordered right away. I waited forever for them to come. When they did, I pulled them out, took one look & threw them away. What a waste of time.",

    "So body wash is one of those things I buy whatever is on sale, as it's not face soap or shampoo, so who cares, right?\n\nI bought this when Amazon had the coupon, and received it via Prime two days later. The first time I used it, the consistency took me aback. It's a blueish greenish brownish grey color (I know, vague, but don't know how to describe it)... the closest thing I can think of is some sort of substance that would come out of a baby's mouth or a#$... very odd. It's thick and somewhat lumpy. Gross.\n\nThe smell was obnoxious as well. It's like a sour stale smell, and it gets in the air and when I breathe in the shower I can feel it in my throat and nostrils... so so strange. It's NOT a pleasant smell or taste. I've never had this issue with any other body wash or soap.\n\nI will never buy this product again.",

In a matter of hours I basically got a 1st degree burn that caused the skin surrounding the zit to turn bright red and then flake off for the next three days.

Extremely poor customer service.",
    "So, I was looking for a scent that smelled like the island flowers, and really captured the beautiful feel and smells of the islands of Hawaii. I took a chance and ordered this fragrance. I shipped it to my job, and when I received it, was super excited....until I opened it. The best way I can describe it would be the smell of a gas station bathroom. Some of my co workers said it smelled worse than that. Some described the smell as \"old lady perfume.\" I am sorry if that is offensive, and I love all the older women in my life, but would absolutely hate if anyone wore this scent around me. It smelled up our office to the point where people we walking by my desk asking what the \"disgusting smell\" was. I was bewildered that 93% of the buyers of this perfume rated it 5 stars, and the other 7% rated it 4!! That's crazy. I tried to return the product, and was not able to because of \"shipping restrictions.\" So, there went $50 down the drain...and the perfume is sitting in it's box under my sink now, because I don't know what to do with it, and it would be pretty offensive to give it to anyone as a present. For the record, I never post reviews, and probably have ever only posted one, and it was a praising review for a restaurant or something. But I feel as though the current reviews of this product are misleading.",
    "I have been a long time Norelco shaver user.  When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor.  Big Mistake!  The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.\n\nWhy you say?  To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings.  In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads.  The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.\n\nBy the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.  You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after \"cleaning.\"\n\nThe bottom line:  In a failed attempt to make a quieter, faster, shaving system, Norelco actually made it WORSE than earlier lift-and-cut models.  Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  Do not waste your hard-earned cash on this sub-par Norelco product.",

I then found \"American Fare\" brand at Kmart (which are still #1 in my book - I'll explain after.)\n\nI was reluctant to try Aqua-Fresh because they were about $5 more then Crest, but after hearing they had even stronger whiteners I bought them. I give them 1 star because I do feel that they did whiten my teeth better and faster then anything else I've used but the delivery system makes them unbearable and I'll never buy them again.\n\nTrays are to small, gel seeps out everywhere *GROSS*, I think I swallowed more then got on my teeth. I gagged and choked, you can't even open your mouth with these things in let alone TALK. So you have to be completely silent and spit out clumps of gel that seep out the entire 30-45 min. I don't even think I have to continue.\n\nTry \"American Fare\" from K-mart. They have the exact same solution as the Crest which all dentists recommend, they're $10 cheaper then the Aqua Fresh, and the trays are made of *wax* so they will mold to your teeth.

When I first turned it on boy was I surprised at the volume!  I don't have a dB meter, but it's loud enough that my daughter, upstairs in another part of the house, complains that it wakes her up.  However, if it did a great job in a short time I'd be accepting of the racket. Alas it did not. It consistently left long hairs on my throat that I had to use the trimmer to get and then go over again with the regular foil.  And on top of that, it was no faster than my Braun and shaved no closer - surprising because my Braun's head was 18 months old and the Remington was brand new.

You're suppose to rub the strip back and forth once you apply it to the wax on your skin but the wax seeps through the strip and is sticky so then you can rub it back and forth for too long.

It weighed down my hair, even when I misted it lightly on my brush and brushed it through my hair.  Within a few hours, the static returned.  I won't buy it again",

    "First off, let me say that I hate body hair and yet somehow was born with the genes of Chewbacca.  I shave a lot.  In the past, I have been using Gillette razors.  But it was getting expensive to constantly buy replacement heads.  So I was excited to try an electric replacement, especially with so many good reviews.  Well, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed.  Believe me, I really tried to give this thing a chance.  But its just not doing the job.  For one, its slow.  I have to run over the same spot several times for it to cut all the hair, when a razor can usually get it all in one zip.  So it takes me probably more than twice the amount of time for my normal routine.  (I shave in the shower.  So by then, I'm out of hot water - no fun).  The other problem is that the end result is NOT smooth at all.  I don't mind a little stubble on my face.  But not on my chest.  I feel like after I'm done I have to go back over it with my razor.  I just don't get it.  How is this product getting so many good reviews?  I count on these to make good purchases.\nI normally wouldn't give just a 1 star rating.  But I feel I need to to offset so many 4s and 5s.  Even for the decent price, its still not worth it.",
    "I thought this castile soap would be good because of the added shea butter (so it wouldn't be as drying as others), but I don't like it. It is still drying but also leaves a weird residue. It smells good in the bottle but once in skin it smells odd and plastic-y. It takes a lot for it to foam up, and it shouldn't because it's supposed to be concentrated..",
    "So crude and painful that I could not use this trimmer. The quality is horrible. It cuts skin easily and pulls stubble. I tried using twice and it is simply impossible.",
    "Did not dry hair at all, just dried out the ends. Returned it.",

    "I stubbed my big toe and tore 1/4 of the nail off back to the root. Eventually I started getting a fungal infection under around the new growth causing it to raise and look bas. I started this products use after reading the reviews 4 months ago.  Makes the nail look shiny and healthy, but it's the oil making it look good.  Been 4 months and  4 bottles later and no real positive results.  & yes I kept my nail trimmed.",
    "I was wrongly mislead by the good reviews posted on this item. I absolutely regret purchasing this shaver. Every time i shaved with it, I was left with prickles allover. It feels like it is doing the job and its very easy on sensitive skin, but the shave just isn't close enough. Overall, I am highly disappointed with this product.",
    "As of October 29, 2007, the instructions specifically say that you must unplug the Norelco Arcitec 1050X shaver from the charger once it's fully charged.  If you don't you will hurt the battery.  I guess you're supposed to baby-sit it every few hours.\n\nThis is an inexcusable design error and the principal reason I am returning this product for a full refund.\n\nIf Norelco had said on the box, \"You have to watch the battery icon till it stops blinking and then you have to unplug the shaver,\" I wouldn't have wasted my time buying it.  Would you?",

It doesn't really hurt anymore and it doesn't feel like it's on the surface, but it wasn't there before I used this.\n\nYou can bet that I'm calling the company on monday and that I'm going to go get this checked out by a dentist.",

    "I was glad to see this product, a multipurpose tooth fortifier! But, this stuff is SO STRONG I can't tolerate having it in my mouth for the full minute indicated by the directions. And if I can't keep my teeth soaking in it, does that mean it isn't doing its job?  Seems like a product buyers should paint  directly on teeth, sit with our mouths open for a few mins, then spit, NOT something you swirl around your gums and delicate oral tissue with your mouth closed for a minute..",

    "I was looking for a new razor to see if I could improve my underarm shaving.  I'm so sorry I tried this one.  It had only been two or three days since I last shaved my legs, but my legs are nowhere near smooth.  There's a fine stubble.  In addition, immediately after use my skin got rashy and itchy anywhere the razor had touched.  One of the worst razors I've ever used -- and a complete waste of my money, as the skin irritation means I don't dare use it again.",

    "Wow!  I wish I had known the problems I would have with this lemon I would've made sure I took Norelco up on their satisfaction guarantee!  I have an old 5601X that works as well.  I expected quicker, closer shaves and it takes just as long.  The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!  I've had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!",

    "Don't believe the hype. I got this because I was sick and tired of my hair stylist giving me flack for using Dove shampoo which, by the way, costs me around $4 and makes my hair look like a million bucks. I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP. I have virgin hair... I straighten my hair often and at the lowest heat setting... and this has never happened prior to switching to this shampoo. Returning. Hope this review helps. I'll stick to my $4 shampoo thank you very much.",

    "Joke.",
    "Bought this to replace my old, worn out cheap braun shaver, which wasn't too bad of a shaver. . It is a very poor razor. It leaves hairs uncut so I have to go over them every few days with the sideburn trimmer to cut them. The batteries don't last very long before needing charging and if they die while shaving you can't finish the shave by plugging in the cord. It will only run after recharging so you better have a backup available to finish the shave.",
    "Not soft at all",
    "Not the genuine product. I thought they must have changed it, but I have since found it in a store recently and I realized this purchase was some sort of knockoff. The smell of the genuine product is amazing. This one is unpleasant. It is also watery. The real one is a thick, viscous oil with a slight orange tinge in the bottle, but goes on clear. This one is very orange. Not even a good knockoff.",
    "I bought this item and it stopped working after a month.  It might claim its waterproof but wouldn't work as well every time I used it in the shower.  I would not buy this again. It was a waste of money.",
    "I have extremely dry skin; in particular, my hands. I've used Eucerin for years. However, the effectiveness of the product has changed recently. Not only does it fail to provide the superb moisturization that it used to do so superbly, but a few minutes after applying it, your hands feel even more dry than they had before. Not only have they removed the components of their formula that worked so well - probably due to manufacturing cost and a drive for profit - but they've greedily and figured out a way to make the consumer of the product use more and more of it in an attempt to achieve any effective moisturization at all. It's almost diabolical - you have to keep reapplying the stuff over and over, just to overcome the dryness that the product itself induces - even though the product was supposed to eliminate dryness in the first place.",
    "Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.",

It took a crazy long time to get delivered, and when it did it looked like it was from South Korea.  It wasn't inexpensive either, so I feel ripped off.",
    "Worthless , can i get a refund?",
    "Worst razors Ive owned by far! Went off reviews and decided to buy, but don't agree with quality stated as they ripped my hair out vs cutting it and caused tons of ingrown hairs. Gillette and Derby blades Ive been buying for the last five years are a much better product. Now Im stuck with 99 unused blades and I cant return them. Waste of money!",

The few times I was able to get the brush through one section of my hair without issue, I didn't see much difference. My hair was still a little frizzy and still very straight. I was expecting more volume and a sleeker, bouncier look. I don't think this brush puts out enough hot air to be a styling tool.",

    "My brief experience with the T770 was similar to Mr. Ginsberg's. I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.\n\nNorelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770.\n\nIt looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.",
    "I would not recommend this product.  I bought it for my fiance. It caused many razor burns and made skin breakout.  His skin was irritated for a two days after and did not even get close to a smooth shave. Sorry, but I do not want to spend this kind of money, when he can get a clean smooth shave from a cheap razor. Product returned!",

    "This product came as a faulty one. I can't charge it with the charger that came with. Actually I can get it to charge if I hold and tilt the shaver to one side but as soon as I let go, it stops charging. I tried using the shaver and I have to say I wouldn't give up my Gillette razor for this. It could be handy if you travel and only need a relatively decent shave, as it didn't cause me razor burn when used dry.",
    "My husband had heard that this was happening, but hoped it wasn't true.  Although we haven't tried all the blades we purchased, of the first group of five, the first two lasted for only 2-3 shaves before showing significant signs of wear.  This is very disappointing, not to mention a shame it might be a waste of money to have purchased these, but we both liked the MP3 best and hoped it would be kept.  I will update my review if it turns out that it was perhaps a bad batch.",

This morning after washing my face with this product, my cheek as well as my nose became bumpy, red and warm. Definitely a bad reaction. I'm guessing its from the cleansing milk and will be discontinuing usage.",

I had a helper but unless you have a pro on hand, good luck with that. Even when when I got the ear utensil in, and I used 3 different kinds, it was out by the morning.

It is something called \"Vor-mag Water(water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration that we believe to be more beneficial) and Rose Damascena (Hydroessential Rose) Flower Oil\" as listed under ingredients. Seeing as oil and water don't mix without a binder this is also a waste of money and false advertising.\n\nThis would probably explain why this product hasn't worked for me. I have used rosewater based products like Thayer's Rose Petal Alcohol-free Witch Hazel toner which has rose water as the first ingredient with great success, but this doesn't work form my acne-prone sensitive skin at all. The only thing I can say for it is that it doesn't irritate my skin, but then again neither does tap water. If you plan on buying rose water and you aren't familiar with the brand or product I would suggest you look at the ingredients beforehand, otherwise don't bother purchasing it at all.",

Almost 30 bucks gone to waste.",
    "The brush doesn't heat up enough to do any good plus it is engineered so that you are holding it over the high/low/off heat setting and constantly shifting it. Not that it matters because it doesn't heat up enough to do any good. Plus there's no automatic shut off and the \"off\" position is between the high and low instead at one end or the other and so it's easy to forget and leave it on when you think you've turned it off. Basically it sucks and it's worthless. I would return it if it weren't more trouble that it's worth.",
    "I'm very disappointed in this product. It used to be of a much higher quality and they have changed the the bleach and trays.\n\nThe trays:\nThey used to be a soft foam that really fit my teeth. The new style was made for people with very small teeth and are flimsy.\n\nThe bleach:\nThe gel bleach is not soft enough to spread evenly across all your teeth. This results in a very uneven bleaching and spotty results. I thought I could maybe spread it and use my custom trays but it's too think and won't spread. There's really no hope in getting even results.\n\nThis product is terrible and I will not be buying it again.",

A single 45min treatment (as described by the packaging) did not whiten my teeth but permantly bleached away the tooth color leaving grey edges!\n\nI do not whiten my teeth regularly, the last time was a crest whitestrip 5years ago (with no problems).

I hated it from the first second I used it.  First of all, it takes me about 3 times as long to shave as it did with the Norelco (whose blades I had NEVER replaced).  Secondly, it scratched up my face to the point of bleeding profusely on my chin and neck.  I never saw this before, EVER, with my Norelco.  Thirdly, after only 3 months, the microscreen started breaking away, exposing the raw blades underneath.  I can no longer use this product as it looks like a cat has scratched my face up.

    "I had a Philips Norelco 20XL which served great for 10 years until the guard comb eventually broke. Bought this one and hoped it would as good. No way! This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.\n1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.\n2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.\n3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!\n4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.\n5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.\n\nAwful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price. I would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one.",
    "After using this it really irritated my skin. I did some research on the ingredients and a lot of what's in it is not good for your skin, especially sensitive skin. Don't buy this! I thought it would be a good product but there are cheaper drug store products that are better exfoliators.",

    "I have used this product for 15+ years- and I am not sure what was going on with this specific bottle, but it is not at all like what I have always used. For one, the serum appears to be pink (which it normally isn't)- it also smells weird, which it normally does not. And it is sticky once I put it on my face. Again, not at all like the product I am used to purchasing. May have to go to a department store in the future, it appears it was altered or something. Very disappointing because this stuff is not cheap.",
    "It's a nice looking comb; however that's the only good thing about it. It's made of 100% plastic so it permanently bends which is not a big deal but since it is plastic it's not durable. A tooth broke within weeks. I have a very old Goodie brand comb that doesn't have broken teeth or is bent. For me, the best pocket combs have some rubber mixed in with the plastic so they don't break. Too bad this one was not that way because it was expensive for a small comb.",
    "I have given this shampoo and conditioner a shot for at least 7 hair washings now and it is horrible. It completely strips my hair of all oil. I have never had any issues with dry hair until using this product. I wash my hair about 3 times a week so it is not that I wash my hair so often that I am stripping it of oil. The worst part is I am stuck with these huge bottles. I will probably use the shampoo for body wash and see how that goes and the conditioner to shave but at this point I may just have to call it a loss and toss both.",
    "Works great, but 3 of them in a row have lasted less than a year before they stop working.  It's inexpensive, but not worth the hassle of buying a new one so often.",
    "Well, even though this item had mixed reviews, I tried it anyway. While the trimmer does work, the promise of no mess with a built in vacuum that actually works is not what you get. The trimmer captures only a portion of the hair that is cut -- and not a particularly impressive portion at that. If you follow the instructions and start with the higher setting and work your way down, it does work better -- but even then, the trimmer only captures about 75% of the trimmings -- which of course results in the rest falling into the sink, onto your shirt, or onto whatever is below. It is possible that this trimmer works better for some types of beards than others, but for me, this is a throw away purchase (literally). Back to my old trimmer.",

Of the 2 my husband and I just ordered, 1 has very little water pressure, even on the highest setting, and the reservoir empties 4 times faster than the last one we'd purchased a year ago.  It does not last long enough for me to clean all my teeth.  The second one is only a little better.  I will never buy this product again.  I can understand an occasional \"lemon\", but we ordered 2 and neither one works well.  So disappointing after being a lifelong fan.",
    "I've had two of these, both of them \"died\" of the same cause.\n\nThe construction for the power button relies on a little sealed container and a plastic spike pressing on the button.\n\nIf air escapes the sealed container, the plastic spike is no longer in contact with the button. You then have to open the whole unit up to let some air back into the sealed container. Of course, doing this opening you risk breaking bits and pieces. It's not impossible, but definitely a design flaw.\n\nI first got one of these in 2006. A second in 2009. Both have \"failed\" in the same way.\n\nI do not recommend this model.",

The biggest problem is with usps have had nothing but problems with them, lkast 4 or 5 orders with them they keep saying they delivered the packages but I never got them, and days later the packages they said I recieved mysteriously end up at thier office and have to go pick them up. If i order from amazoned again and find out thye are using usps for delivery I will cancel order I want nothing to to with them, just this one order have spent hours trying to reslove this and am getting very fustrated.",
    "This product does a good job of cleaning, as long as it's working!  Mine was about 2 months old when the thumb button--which, when depressed, stops the flow of the water to keep messes to a minimum--became stuck, so no water would flow.  It had been an intermittent problem prior to that, but now it is permanently stuck.  In trying to get it to release, the entire handle split open--and still the button was stuck down.\nI had an older Water Pik model before this one, which also quit working after a few months' time.  I am looking for a new brand......",
    "I was unimpressed with the stand so I returned it. It didn't hold my Gillette Mach3 razor well, it kept falling out as the razor neck isn't high enough to hold the standard razor. This is more for a razor with a special pommel. It held my brush just fine though the handle didn't fit so I had to set it on top of the stand with the bristles only under the handle.\n\nThe service and company was great, the product just didn't serve my needs.",

    "This \"men's cutting system\" unfortunately has all the hallmarks of cheap Chinese-made junk toys. This can barely handle anything more than 5 o'clock shadow, and I don't recommend it. I bought mine a few months ago and I do not use it now, because it popped open while shaving and the head assembly was reduced to about a dozen parts. Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don't understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.",
    "Absolutely tore my face up.  Worst shaving experience of my life.  Have 99 left to give or throw away.  Very disappointed!",
    "this thin sucks!  if you want a crappy trimmer and basically the male equivalent of an epilady for your junk, then get this product.  i used it for like 2 weeks and then tossed it in a drawer and went back to my blade razor/beard trimmer system that always got things done.  using it in the shower makes it even less effective.  now, i know shaving the old bean bag is never simple and trying to get a turkeyneck to be a smooth surface isn't easy, but a blade razor can get the job done no problem when you pull it all out like a bat-wing and get to it.  even doing this didn't work....and forget hitting the taint.  this thing was brutal.  i didn't want to end up a eunuch, so this had to go.",
    "Like almost all other electric shavers I have owned, it does a great job for about the first 3 weeks until the foil and blades wear out.  Then, for the mere price of close to $50 to $70, you can order new foil and block if you want to return it to its original effectiveness.  There are third-party foil/block makers for this model, and if you go that way, you will pay $30-40 for a new foil/block, and it will last you 2 weeks instead of 3.  Other big issue -- clippers stopped working in less than one year.  Next issue -- simply the loudest, noisiest shaver I have ever owned.",
    "I have long hair all the way down to my waist. I have been trying to get away from store bought shampoos since the weird ingredients seem to dry out the skin on my scalp and around my hairline. I was super excited when I got this. However, when I used it, there was ABSOLUTELY ZERO SUDS! I used a LOT trying to work up a lather and there was just barely any froth. My hair was left so tangled I had to use EXTRA conditioner to work the knots out with my wide-tooth comb. Normally the comb runs right through detangling with conditioner in the shower. May work for someone with short hair but waste of money for me and added aggravation with long, thick hair.",
    "Like everyone else is saying, these blades are fake.  If you look closely at the razor, the blades aren't on straight and the edges are dull.  Needless to say, trying to shave with them is like using a cheese grater on your face.",

When I call customer service they tell me that I cannot get any more replacement handles under the warantee because I am not using it properly since I leave the water in overnight.  I had three Waterpiks in the past and I have always left the water in with no problem.  They said I could buy a new handle but it costs half the price of what I paid for the unit.\n\nVERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  THREE YEAR WARANTEE MEANS NOTHING IF THEY MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON IT.",
    "I bought this based on reviews and that it was water based instead of latex. Extremely messy, let it dry for 20 minutes once I applied it a second time I put the system in place and the very next day after a shower the whole thing came loose. Nice idea, but its futile. Now I'm stuck with an overpriced bottle of Elmers glue for my daughters kindergarden projects. I went and bought two days later Ultra Hold and that does what it says it does. My review about the seller was positive although the product is terrible.",
    "These clippers did not work. Don't waste your money!",
    "I had bought a Conair brush years ago that I loved, however the ball tips finally started to fall out. It was nice, light and glided through my hair without any snags. I decided to try something different based on the reviews and I am so utterly disappointed in this brush! The first thing I noticed when taking this out of the box is how heavy it is. This brush definitely has some weight to it and is clunky to hold while brushing my long hair. I also have baby fine hair and the plastic silver looking  area that attaches the brush head to the handle catches it something fierce. It's practically guaranteed to snag and pull out a hair any time I use it. The only redeeming quality is that this brush doesn't look half bad. I received a blue one, which I can pass off to my brother who doesn't have to worry about any hair snagging.",

    "The merchant was quick to take my money, but when I contacted this merchant in regards to returning the item for a refund, I never heard back. I contacted them twice and allowed 3 business days to respond. I had to open my first Amazon A-Z dispute!\n\nThe merchant's description of this expensive, \"magical\" product is very vague. He / she should have listed the herbal extracts included and the actual description on the bottles. It is highly unlikely that this product will deliver the miracle results as advertised.\n\nWhile \"Mentha piperita (peppermint) extract, caraway oil extract, ginger oil, geranium oil, & fennel seed oil\" may aid in digestion, they certainly will not dissolve gallstones. The second bottle included suggests to \"start taking capsules after 1 week of taking softgels,\" which claims to flush out the stones with extracts like Grape and \"Ginseng,\" a common ingredient found in energy drinks. Why pay $50 for something that \"has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration?\" You're better off with a doctor's prescription of Ursodiol for dissolving gallstones less than 2 cm -- this typically takes anywhere from 6 to 18 months. Or if you want to go the natural route, then I'd recommend \"Christopher's Liver and Gallbladder Formula\" with similar ingredients like Fennel Seed, Ginger, Peppermint\" for less than 1/5 of the price!",

    "I did read reviews half good half bad but i didn't think it was THIS bad. The trays honestly refuse to stay in place. It took 2 tries for me to get them to stay in my mouth (by clenching my jaw for the 45 minutes of horror) To notice that after all of the gel slips and slides around (and out of the tray) that only HALF of my teeth were whiter after every use. Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don't look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don't eat after i use the trays. Over all I've gotten alo't more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle.",

    "I don't find these blades particularly sharp.  They're sharp enough to cute yourself, but I require several passes with these blades to get a remotely close shave.\n\nI had recently purchased both the Weishi razor and this pack of blades.  I used the blades that came with the razor first, which were reviewed horribly by most people, and with not much experience overall I agreed that the blades were bad.  Then I started using these blades.  I have to assume I have a bad batch or something since these seem worse to me.\n\nMine are wrapped in white paper and have the wax seal which has been commented on in the Q/A section as possibly being the old style, maybe not the genuine blades, who knows.  I don't like them whichever type they are.\n\nI get maybe 3 \"good\" shaves with them, then struggle with day 4 or 5 if I can bear it.  I see no value in using them since I go through them at a pace much quicker than a comparable cartridge razor, and at what will be a higher cost for me.  Buy them at your own risk.",

Probably going to avoid Mitchum all together for awhile now.",
    "This is the third Norelco shaver I've owned.  The first two gave an excellent, close, even shave and the charge lasted several weeks.  On my last vacation I forgot the charging cord and it turned on in my suitcase so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.  I'm finally getting rid of this piece of junk today and I'm going to buy a different electric razor.",

    "I bought this item (based on good reviews) to replace a different brand shaver that kept losing power. This shaver is essentially useless. I ended up using my half powered old one. First off, it's way too wide for the bikini area. It's hard to get it in the hip crease area. Second, I could not get this thing to trim any hairs at all. I compared the guard and it's the same length on the shortest setting as my old one. It has two blades going back and forth, just doesn't cut hair. It may work if you only trim once every several months, but do not buy this for general maintenance."

It's a blueish greenish brownish grey color (I know, vague, but don't know how to describe it)... the closest thing I can think of is some sort of substance that would come out of a baby's mouth or a#$... very odd. It's thick and somewhat lumpy. Gross.\n\nThe smell was obnoxious as well. It's like a sour stale smell, and it gets in the air and when I breathe in the shower I can feel it in my throat and nostrils... so so strange. It's NOT a pleasant smell or taste.

I shipped it to my job, and when I received it, was super excited....until I opened it. The best way I can describe it would be the smell of a gas station bathroom. Some of my co workers said it smelled worse than that. Some described the smell as \"old lady perfume.\" I am sorry if that is offensive, and I love all the older women in my life, but would absolutely hate if anyone wore this scent around me. It smelled up our office to the point where people we walking by my desk asking what the \"disgusting smell\" was. I was bewildered that 93% of the buyers of this perfume rated it 5 stars, and the other 7% rated it 4!! That's crazy. I tried to return the product, and was not able to because of \"shipping restrictions.\" So, there went $50 down the drain...and the perfume is sitting in it's box under my sink now, because I don't know what to do with it, and it would be pretty offensive to give it to anyone as a present.

I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP.

I took a chance and ordered this fragrance. I shipped it to my job, and when I received it, was super excited....until I opened it. The best way I can describe it would be the smell of a gas station bathroom. Some of my co workers said it smelled worse than that. Some described the smell as \"old lady perfume.\" I am sorry if that is offensive, and I love all the older women in my life, but would absolutely hate if anyone wore this scent around me. It smelled up our office to the point where people we walking by my desk asking what the \"disgusting smell\" was. I was bewildered that 93% of the buyers of this perfume rated it 5 stars, and the other 7% rated it 4!! That's crazy. I tried to return the product, and was not able to because of \"shipping restrictions.\" So, there went $50 down the drain...and the perfume is sitting in it's box under my sink now, because I don't know what to do with it, and it would be pretty offensive to give it to anyone as a present. For the record, I never post reviews, and probably have ever only posted one, and it was a praising review for a restaurant or something. But I feel as though the current reviews of this product are misleading.",

However, if it did a great job in a short time I'd be accepting of the racket. Alas it did not. It consistently left long hairs on my throat that I had to use the trimmer to get and then go over again with the regular foil.

I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old 3605X. The 3605X was one of the cheapest cordless models at the time, but has performed well over the years. I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak. A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model. It was poor and returned it. This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL. Also thought it might help that is was made in Holland as opposed to the ones from China. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.\n\nThe biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X. Why does that matter? Ever tried to shave with a low battery? Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does. Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.\n\nI am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors. At this point I will probably return this one, too.",

If you already bought the product or plan to buy it, be sure to purchase tweezers to complete the job.  In addition, the gel is messy and hard to manage; a real thick, hard ball - imagine honey that is kept past the expiration date.  Also, the strips of fabric fray at the edges, so those threads get stuck in the goo mess.  You can see from the other Nads links here at Amazon that other customers have had the same experience.",

It gives a very poor shave and causes razor burn at the same time. I had thought that these two conditions were mutually exclusive, but Phillips has managed to put them both in this razor. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.\n\nI replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.\n\nIf I were Phillips, I would do what Ford did with the Edsel and withdraw it from the market before it damages their reputation any further.",

I bought two of them and mounted them.  And in the middle of the night, they both ejected themselves off of the wall and into the tub -- making a truly horrible racket and waking us all up!  I tried the whole thing again the next day, but they did the same thing.  Remember, this is with NOTHING in them!  They can't even hold up their own weight, much less the added weight of toys!

I felt, after all this time, maybe Norelco had improved the shaver, so I ordered a new one. I was wrong. The old one, the Norelco 5845 XL, is superior to the new one. The only advantage of the 7810 is, it's quieter. I'm left wondering, if I had received the 7810 XL, which is what thought I was ordering, would it have been as good as my old razor. Now,of course, I'll always wonder.",

Min. length that you can get is 2.5 mm , so think twice if it's enough for you!\nThird, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality! It feels really cheap in one's hand.

The water in the container won't last more than 10 seconds if you don't put it on the lowest pressure.

        "I have been a long time Norelco shaver user.  When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor.  Big Mistake!  The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.\n\nWhy you say?  To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings.  In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads.  The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.\n\nBy the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.  You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after \"cleaning.\"\n\nThe bottom line:  In a failed attempt to make a quieter, faster, shaving system, Norelco actually made it WORSE than earlier lift-and-cut models.  Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  Do not waste your hard-earned cash on this sub-par Norelco product.",

This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP.

Not only does it fail to provide the superb moisturization that it used to do so superbly, but a few minutes after applying it, your hands feel even more dry than they had before. Not only have they removed the components of their formula that worked so well - probably due to manufacturing cost and a drive for profit - but they've greedily and figured out a way to make the consumer of the product use more and more of it in an attempt to achieve any effective moisturization at all. It's almost diabolical - you have to keep reapplying the stuff over and over, just to overcome the dryness that the product itself induces - even though the product was supposed to eliminate dryness in the first place.",

I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.\n\nNorelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770.\n\nIt looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.",

I hated it from the first second I used it.  First of all, it takes me about 3 times as long to shave as it did with the Norelco (whose blades I had NEVER replaced).  Secondly, it scratched up my face to the point of bleeding profusely on my chin and neck.  I never saw this before, EVER, with my Norelco.

        "Well, even though this item had mixed reviews, I tried it anyway. While the trimmer does work, the promise of no mess with a built in vacuum that actually works is not what you get. The trimmer captures only a portion of the hair that is cut -- and not a particularly impressive portion at that. If you follow the instructions and start with the higher setting and work your way down, it does work better -- but even then, the trimmer only captures about 75% of the trimmings -- which of course results in the rest falling into the sink, onto your shirt, or onto whatever is below. It is possible that this trimmer works better for some types of beards than others, but for me, this is a throw away purchase (literally). Back to my old trimmer.",

Of the 2 my husband and I just ordered, 1 has very little water pressure, even on the highest setting, and the reservoir empties 4 times faster than the last one we'd purchased a year ago.  It does not last long enough for me to clean all my teeth.  The second one is only a little better.  I will never buy this product again.  I can understand an occasional \"lemon\", but we ordered 2 and neither one works well.  So disappointing after being a lifelong fan.",

I bought mine a few months ago and I do not use it now, because it popped open while shaving and the head assembly was reduced to about a dozen parts. Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don't understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.",

My hair was left so tangled I had to use EXTRA conditioner to work the knots out with my wide-tooth comb. Normally the comb runs right through detangling with conditioner in the shower.

I decided to try something different based on the reviews and I am so utterly disappointed in this brush! The first thing I noticed when taking this out of the box is how heavy it is. This brush definitely has some weight to it and is clunky to hold while brushing my long hair. I also have baby fine hair and the plastic silver looking  area that attaches the brush head to the handle catches it something fierce. It's practically guaranteed to snag and pull out a hair any time I use it. The only redeeming quality is that this brush doesn't look half bad. I received a blue one, which I can pass off to my brother who doesn't have to worry about any hair snagging.",

It took 2 tries for me to get them to stay in my mouth (by clenching my jaw for the 45 minutes of horror) To notice that after all of the gel slips and slides around (and out of the tray) that only HALF of my teeth were whiter after every use. Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don't look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don't eat after i use the trays. Over all I've gotten alo't more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle.",

On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.

First off, it's way too wide for the bikini area. It's hard to get it in the hip crease area. Second, I could not get this thing to trim any hairs at all. I compared the guard and it's the same length on the shortest setting as my old one. It has two blades going back and forth, just doesn't cut hair. It may work if you only trim once every several months, but do not buy this for general maintenance."

If you already bought the product or plan to buy it, be sure to purchase tweezers to complete the job.  In addition, the gel is messy and hard to manage; a real thick, hard ball - imagine honey that is kept past the expiration date.

I would not recommend the purchase of this product. The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.\n\nI replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.\n\nIf I were Phillips, I would do what Ford did with the Edsel and withdraw it from the market before it damages their reputation any further.",

I have to guess that CR tested it for a day or so, and the positive reviewers here wrote their reviews after a week or less.  The \"microscreen\" is incredibly flimsy.  Within 3 weeks, mine developed a slit that grew a little every day.  The blades underneath contact your skin through the slit, and hack you up like Freddy Krueger.  Then you need to replace the microscreens at $20 each.  It's a good razor while the screen lasts, but if you need to replace it every month at $20/each, why bother?",

I expected quicker, closer shaves and it takes just as long.  The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!  I've had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!",

I got this because I was sick and tired of my hair stylist giving me flack for using Dove shampoo which, by the way, costs me around $4 and makes my hair look like a million bucks. I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP. I have virgin hair... I straighten my hair often and at the lowest heat setting... and this has never happened prior to switching to this shampoo. Returning. Hope this review helps. I'll stick to my $4 shampoo thank you very much.",

I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak. A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model. It was poor and returned it. This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL. Also thought it might help that is was made in Holland as opposed to the ones from China. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.\n\nThe biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X. Why does that matter? Ever tried to shave with a low battery? Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does. Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.\n\nI am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors. At this point I will probably return this one, too.",

I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger.

I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP.

It leaves hairs uncut so I have to go over them every few days with the sideburn trimmer to cut them.

Not only does it fail to provide the superb moisturization that it used to do so superbly, but a few minutes after applying it, your hands feel even more dry than they had before. Not only have they removed the components of their formula that worked so well - probably due to manufacturing cost and a drive for profit - but they've greedily and figured out a way to make the consumer of the product use more and more of it in an attempt to achieve any effective moisturization at all. It's almost diabolical - you have to keep reapplying the stuff over and over, just to overcome the dryness that the product itself induces - even though the product was supposed to eliminate dryness in the first place.",

I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.\n\nNorelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770.\n\nIt looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.",

I hated it from the first second I used it.  First of all, it takes me about 3 times as long to shave as it did with the Norelco (whose blades I had NEVER replaced).  Secondly, it scratched up my face to the point of bleeding profusely on my chin and neck.  I never saw this before, EVER, with my Norelco.  Thirdly, after only 3 months, the microscreen started breaking away, exposing the raw blades underneath.  I can no longer use this product as it looks like a cat has scratched my face up.

This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.\n1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.\n2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.\n3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!\n4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.\n5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.\n\nAwful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price.

The trimmer captures only a portion of the hair that is cut -- and not a particularly impressive portion at that. If you follow the instructions and start with the higher setting and work your way down, it does work better -- but even then, the trimmer only captures about 75% of the trimmings -- which of course results in the rest falling into the sink, onto your shirt, or onto whatever is below. It is possible that this trimmer works better for some types of beards than others, but for me, this is a throw away purchase (literally). Back to my old trimmer.",

Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don't understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.",

I decided to try something different based on the reviews and I am so utterly disappointed in this brush! The first thing I noticed when taking this out of the box is how heavy it is. This brush definitely has some weight to it and is clunky to hold while brushing my long hair. I also have baby fine hair and the plastic silver looking  area that attaches the brush head to the handle catches it something fierce. It's practically guaranteed to snag and pull out a hair any time I use it. The only redeeming quality is that this brush doesn't look half bad. I received a blue one, which I can pass off to my brother who doesn't have to worry about any hair snagging.",

It took 2 tries for me to get them to stay in my mouth (by clenching my jaw for the 45 minutes of horror) To notice that after all of the gel slips and slides around (and out of the tray) that only HALF of my teeth were whiter after every use. Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don't look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don't eat after i use the trays. Over all I've gotten alo't more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle.",

On my last vacation I forgot the charging cord and it turned on in my suitcase so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.  I'm finally getting rid of this piece of junk today and I'm going to buy a different electric razor.",

I compared the guard and it's the same length on the shortest setting as my old one. It has two blades going back and forth, just doesn't cut hair.

I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old 3605X. The 3605X was one of the cheapest cordless models at the time, but has performed well over the years. I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak. A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model. It was poor and returned it. This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL. Also thought it might help that is was made in Holland as opposed to the ones from China. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.\n\nThe biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X. Why does that matter? Ever tried to shave with a low battery? Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does. Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.\n\nI am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors. At this point I will probably return this one, too.",

        "I have owned two of these clippers / groomers - and I have to say - that they are a sheer waste of money and time -esp. if you have a decent amount of body hair. They don't really cut hair - there is more pulling than cutting. And it takes for ever to shave my chest hair - i have go over the same spot over 10 times to get a clean cut. Shaving my chest with this useless device takes upto 1/2 hour or more and a lot of redness and pain. Definitely not worth it.",
        "After 6 weeks, the handle broke.  Contacted manufacturer by Email - they responded 10 days later.  Promised replacement handle in 10-15 days.  A month later, no handle.  No response to new Email.\n\nI remember when these were better made and lasted years.",

        "For the Remington MS2 390 I read a few reviews that said this shaver was made out of cheap parts and i overlooked them, I should have listened because it didn't take much time for the replacement blades needing to be changed and the 1st ones were fine but everytime new heads were put on the place that holds them is made out of plastic and gets worn out making keeping the new heads in place impossible.\nIf your only going to use this shaver for less than a year then go ahead",
        "Garbage!  Literally broke into pieces after 2nd use.  Not even worth the postage...not to mention, not worth the wait either!  Took almost 2 months to show up!",
        "After having this product about 1 week i dropped it from approximately 10 inches.  I dented the weak \"titanium\" microscreen and had to order new ones at 30 dollars a piece.  I soon realized that I was running out of charge extremely fast and noticed that when i was plugging the unit in it was not charging (completely separate and unrelated to the 10 inch drop).  I would have to wiggle the charging plug back and forth several times before the charging light would come on.  Eventually after about 2 months this razor refused to charge and to the trash it went.  A month later my Remington haircutter also died, NOT IMPRESSSED.  I've had my less powerful Norelco electric razor for over 6 years and I've never had a problem.  Also the rubberized outside button is very cheap and could easily get torn or ripped, as for the \"titanium\" finish on the outside its just a cheap paint job. OVERALL i think im done with remington.",
        "This bristles on this brush are extremely stiff.  It hurts to use, even with the slightest pressure.  To make matter worse, dark mold started growing between the bristles after a couple weeks - haven't had a back brush do that before.  This is a total failure and cannot be recommended.",
        "No Stars, total waste of money. Might as well set fire to a  twenty, at least you'll get something out of that(warmth & light).",
        "Okay...where do I start? It does not rotate like it says it does. You turn it on...off to grab another piece of hair and it won't turn back on again!! Awful!",
        "Waste of money. Feels cheaply made. I tried putting it on the highest pressure to see how it can hold. Unfortunately, it just start squirting water bit by bits out. It's not like a constant stream like you see in the commercials. Any pressure higher than 4 would cause the handle to shake and makes it hard to hold. Water also started leaking out from the handle. The water in the container won't last more than 10 seconds if you don't put it on the lowest pressure. The lower pressures don't even seem to make any difference..,might as well just throw some water in your mouth. For returns, they charge $10 and up. Overall, not worth it.",
        "Stopped working after 6 months of use.  Company would not replace before the year warranty was up.  They said they did not sell them anymore.  Too late for a refund as well. Very disappointed  with purchase.",

Oh boy, how wrong was I.\n\nFirst of all, this waterpik has tons of water leaking through the base. Upon closer examination I found out the hose attachment near the bottom of the waterpik has a crack already- and I haven't even used it once! OMFG\n\nThen there's the non-functional on/off switch. It's forever stuck at the on position and I cannot get it to rest at the off position. *facepalm* Defective product is defective. Seller won't refund or exchange any opened merchandise, so good fight to me. Looks like I lost $60 for this POS.",
        "This shaver is a piece of junk.  we ordered it around Christmas.  it worked fine for a month, then fell apart.  There was no way of putting it back together again.  Cheap materials, cheap execution, etc.  We just threw it away.  Will never buy a Norelco again.",

        "I have purchased this product at least t 6 times because I liked the way it works...WHEN IT WORKS!\nDONT ( i repeat DON'T) expect it to last more than 2 months.  Some only lasted weeks.\nFor some reason there are not many blow dryers of this kind that heat from the inside out on the market.  there should be.\nSo I resorted to buying this one multiple times. OVERHEATS AND CONKS OUT\n  My last one lasted thru 4 blow dries and DIED... I am done with it now.",
        "I have been a long time Norelco shaver user.  When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor.  Big Mistake!  The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.\n\nWhy you say?  To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings.  In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads.  The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.\n\nBy the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.  You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after \"cleaning.\"\n\nThe bottom line:  In a failed attempt to make a quieter, faster, shaving system, Norelco actually made it WORSE than earlier lift-and-cut models.  Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  Do not waste your hard-earned cash on this sub-par Norelco product.",
        "Doesn't seem to stay on no matter what I do.",
        "The first time that I turned it on, the handle got extremely hot (and no hot air ever came out of the brush) then quit worked.  It never turned back on even when it cooled down.  I returned it immediately.\n\nBut, I did like the size and brush.",
        "I've had this device for a few months now, and only used it about once every other week.  The part that adjusts the trim length has now broken off and I can no long set a trim length.  This pretty much ruins my ability to use the device, which is why I have to give it a one star.  Before this part broke I would have given it four stars, but the part was cheap and should have been foreseeable that it would break.",
        "I sent mine back the next week of getting it. The cutters cut a big cut on my face when the foil failed. I would NOT recommend this razor to my worst enemy. Don't Buy It!!!",

        "I was so excited to find a curl release round brush blow dryer/styler. I immediately tried it because my hair happened to be damp when it arrived. It tangled my hair 3 out of 4 times. My hair got caught in the brush so badly that I was seriously concerned I would have to cut it out. I have used these type of stylers numerous times and I am 53 years old, it is not human error. The rubber grips the hair and the release feature is ineffective. The company does not accept returns but Amazon offered amazing service!",

That means that if  there are more than 2 people who want to use this machine, for example,  before you go to bed, the machine will turn off because of overheating!  The company obviously knows that the motor is insufficient for usage,  hence the sticker.  Save your money, and do not buy this machine.",

It doesn't really hurt anymore and it doesn't feel like it's on the surface, but it wasn't there before I used this.\n\nYou can bet that I'm calling the company on monday and that I'm going to go get this checked out by a dentist.",

It had only been two or three days since I last shaved my legs, but my legs are nowhere near smooth.  There's a fine stubble.  In addition, immediately after use my skin got rashy and itchy anywhere the razor had touched.  One of the worst razors I've ever used -- and a complete waste of my money, as the skin irritation means I don't dare use it again.",

I expected quicker, closer shaves and it takes just as long.  The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!  I've had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!",

        "Don't believe the hype. I got this because I was sick and tired of my hair stylist giving me flack for using Dove shampoo which, by the way, costs me around $4 and makes my hair look like a million bucks. I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP. I have virgin hair... I straighten my hair often and at the lowest heat setting... and this has never happened prior to switching to this shampoo. Returning. Hope this review helps. I'll stick to my $4 shampoo thank you very much.",
        "Bought this to replace my old, worn out cheap braun shaver, which wasn't too bad of a shaver. . It is a very poor razor. It leaves hairs uncut so I have to go over them every few days with the sideburn trimmer to cut them. The batteries don't last very long before needing charging and if they die while shaving you can't finish the shave by plugging in the cord. It will only run after recharging so you better have a backup available to finish the shave.",
        "I bought this item and it stopped working after a month.  It might claim its waterproof but wouldn't work as well every time I used it in the shower.  I would not buy this again. It was a waste of money.",
        "I have extremely dry skin; in particular, my hands. I've used Eucerin for years. However, the effectiveness of the product has changed recently. Not only does it fail to provide the superb moisturization that it used to do so superbly, but a few minutes after applying it, your hands feel even more dry than they had before. Not only have they removed the components of their formula that worked so well - probably due to manufacturing cost and a drive for profit - but they've greedily and figured out a way to make the consumer of the product use more and more of it in an attempt to achieve any effective moisturization at all. It's almost diabolical - you have to keep reapplying the stuff over and over, just to overcome the dryness that the product itself induces - even though the product was supposed to eliminate dryness in the first place.",

It took a crazy long time to get delivered, and when it did it looked like it was from South Korea.  It wasn't inexpensive either, so I feel ripped off.",

        "My brief experience with the T770 was similar to Mr. Ginsberg's. I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.\n\nNorelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770.\n\nIt looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.",
        "Bought this product, after 4 times of using the charger, it completely stopped functioning. Bought one again, same thing happened.\nRoommate bought one, it broke even faster.",
        "My husband had heard that this was happening, but hoped it wasn't true.  Although we haven't tried all the blades we purchased, of the first group of five, the first two lasted for only 2-3 shaves before showing significant signs of wear.  This is very disappointing, not to mention a shame it might be a waste of money to have purchased these, but we both liked the MP3 best and hoped it would be kept.  I will update my review if it turns out that it was perhaps a bad batch.",
        "The first time I used it the sponge to clean between the toes was great! After the fourth time I used it the sponge came apart! This has to be the worst thing Ive ever purchased! Nothing more than s piece of junk! Buying extra sponges, which are not offered , would be too costly if they only last for four showers a person would have to buy about 100 a year! Not even worth 1star!",

I used the wooden correctors as well as the foam correctors MANY times. First of all, it takes 4 to 6 minutes (4 is a crock) to adhere-try and get a young  dog to be quiet that long. I had a helper but unless you have a pro on hand, good luck with that. Even when when I got the ear utensil in, and I used 3 different kinds, it was out by the morning. I will never use this stuff again for anything! I'm going to the vet for the second time tomorrow. SHE will get the job done with another product.",
        "I'm very disappointed in this product. It used to be of a much higher quality and they have changed the the bleach and trays.\n\nThe trays:\nThey used to be a soft foam that really fit my teeth. The new style was made for people with very small teeth and are flimsy.\n\nThe bleach:\nThe gel bleach is not soft enough to spread evenly across all your teeth. This results in a very uneven bleaching and spotty results. I thought I could maybe spread it and use my custom trays but it's too think and won't spread. There's really no hope in getting even results.\n\nThis product is terrible and I will not be buying it again.",
        "This should have a huge warning on box!  I used one tray of the 7 day treatment, for only the recommended time. Not only did it burn but it permantly destroyed the dentin inside my teeth making them translucent!\n\nMy teeth now appear grey along the bite line (incisal edges).  A single 45min treatment (as described by the packaging) did not whiten my teeth but permantly bleached away the tooth color leaving grey edges!\n\nI do not whiten my teeth regularly, the last time was a crest whitestrip 5years ago (with no problems).  This was a single treatment of the recommended 7 and it permantly damaged my tooth color.\n\nApparently many females have translucent incisal edges, and the is absolutely no warning on the box about this potential side effect!!!",
        "It is useless for a long lasting cap.  If you are immediately going to go to the dentist, then this item will work I suppose.

        "I had a Philips Norelco 20XL which served great for 10 years until the guard comb eventually broke. Bought this one and hoped it would as good. No way! This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.\n1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.\n2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.\n3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!\n4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.\n5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.\n\nAwful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price. I would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one.",
        "It's a nice looking comb; however that's the only good thing about it. It's made of 100% plastic so it permanently bends which is not a big deal but since it is plastic it's not durable. A tooth broke within weeks. I have a very old Goodie brand comb that doesn't have broken teeth or is bent. For me, the best pocket combs have some rubber mixed in with the plastic so they don't break. Too bad this one was not that way because it was expensive for a small comb.",
        "I have given this shampoo and conditioner a shot for at least 7 hair washings now and it is horrible. It completely strips my hair of all oil. I have never had any issues with dry hair until using this product. I wash my hair about 3 times a week so it is not that I wash my hair so often that I am stripping it of oil. The worst part is I am stuck with these huge bottles. I will probably use the shampoo for body wash and see how that goes and the conditioner to shave but at this point I may just have to call it a loss and toss both.",
        "Works great, but 3 of them in a row have lasted less than a year before they stop working.  It's inexpensive, but not worth the hassle of buying a new one so often.",

        "I have used Waterpik brand for over 30 years.  I have owned 4 in that time.  Boy, has this product gone downhill.  This first one lasted over 20 years.  The third one broke after a year.  Of the 2 my husband and I just ordered, 1 has very little water pressure, even on the highest setting, and the reservoir empties 4 times faster than the last one we'd purchased a year ago.  It does not last long enough for me to clean all my teeth.  The second one is only a little better.  I will never buy this product again.  I can understand an occasional \"lemon\", but we ordered 2 and neither one works well.  So disappointing after being a lifelong fan.",
        "I've had two of these, both of them \"died\" of the same cause.\n\nThe construction for the power button relies on a little sealed container and a plastic spike pressing on the button.\n\nIf air escapes the sealed container, the plastic spike is no longer in contact with the button. You then have to open the whole unit up to let some air back into the sealed container. Of course, doing this opening you risk breaking bits and pieces. It's not impossible, but definitely a design flaw.\n\nI first got one of these in 2006. A second in 2009. Both have \"failed\" in the same way.\n\nI do not recommend this model.",
        "This product does a good job of cleaning, as long as it's working!  Mine was about 2 months old when the thumb button--which, when depressed, stops the flow of the water to keep messes to a minimum--became stuck, so no water would flow.  It had been an intermittent problem prior to that, but now it is permanently stuck.  In trying to get it to release, the entire handle split open--and still the button was stuck down.\nI had an older Water Pik model before this one, which also quit working after a few months' time.  I am looking for a new brand......",
        "I have purchased many, at least ten Norelco shavers over the years for my husband. I am very disappointed in their product. None of the shavers have held up. I urge people to buy another brand...I'm just frustrated that they don't live up to what Norelco used to be.",
        "This \"men's cutting system\" unfortunately has all the hallmarks of cheap Chinese-made junk toys. This can barely handle anything more than 5 o'clock shadow, and I don't recommend it. I bought mine a few months ago and I do not use it now, because it popped open while shaving and the head assembly was reduced to about a dozen parts. Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don't understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.",
        "this thin sucks!  if you want a crappy trimmer and basically the male equivalent of an epilady for your junk, then get this product.  i used it for like 2 weeks and then tossed it in a drawer and went back to my blade razor/beard trimmer system that always got things done.  using it in the shower makes it even less effective.  now, i know shaving the old bean bag is never simple and trying to get a turkeyneck to be a smooth surface isn't easy, but a blade razor can get the job done no problem when you pull it all out like a bat-wing and get to it.  even doing this didn't work....and forget hitting the taint.  this thing was brutal.  i didn't want to end up a eunuch, so this had to go.",
        "Like almost all other electric shavers I have owned, it does a great job for about the first 3 weeks until the foil and blades wear out.  Then, for the mere price of close to $50 to $70, you can order new foil and block if you want to return it to its original effectiveness.  There are third-party foil/block makers for this model, and if you go that way, you will pay $30-40 for a new foil/block, and it will last you 2 weeks instead of 3.  Other big issue -- clippers stopped working in less than one year.  Next issue -- simply the loudest, noisiest shaver I have ever owned.",
        "The product works well when it works.  In last 3 years, I have had to replace this 3 times.  The latest one lasted only 1 use.  The functional use is good but the cheap quality is disappointing.",

When I call customer service they tell me that I cannot get any more replacement handles under the warantee because I am not using it properly since I leave the water in overnight.  I had three Waterpiks in the past and I have always left the water in with no problem.  They said I could buy a new handle but it costs half the price of what I paid for the unit.\n\nVERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  THREE YEAR WARANTEE MEANS NOTHING IF THEY MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON IT.",
        "I bought this based on reviews and that it was water based instead of latex. Extremely messy, let it dry for 20 minutes once I applied it a second time I put the system in place and the very next day after a shower the whole thing came loose. Nice idea, but its futile. Now I'm stuck with an overpriced bottle of Elmers glue for my daughters kindergarden projects. I went and bought two days later Ultra Hold and that does what it says it does. My review about the seller was positive although the product is terrible.",

I decided to try something different based on the reviews and I am so utterly disappointed in this brush! The first thing I noticed when taking this out of the box is how heavy it is. This brush definitely has some weight to it and is clunky to hold while brushing my long hair. I also have baby fine hair and the plastic silver looking  area that attaches the brush head to the handle catches it something fierce. It's practically guaranteed to snag and pull out a hair any time I use it. The only redeeming quality is that this brush doesn't look half bad. I received a blue one, which I can pass off to my brother who doesn't have to worry about any hair snagging.",

On my last vacation I forgot the charging cord and it turned on in my suitcase so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.

I compared the guard and it's the same length on the shortest setting as my old one. It has two blades going back and forth, just doesn't cut hair. It may work if you only trim once every several months, but do not buy this for general maintenance."

I bought mine a few months ago and I do not use it now, because it popped open while shaving and the head assembly was reduced to about a dozen parts. Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don't understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months."

            "Like some other reviewers I am disappointed in the 7810XL. Maybe not poor by today's standards, but poor compared to what Norleco used to produce.  I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old 3605X. The 3605X was one of the cheapest cordless models at the time, but has performed well over the years. I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak. A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model. It was poor and returned it. This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL. Also thought it might help that is was made in Holland as opposed to the ones from China. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.\n\nThe biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X. Why does that matter? Ever tried to shave with a low battery? Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does. Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.\n\nI am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors. At this point I will probably return this one, too.",

I go over areas 5-6 times, and the hair is still there! It even managed to cut my skin while my hair stayed intact. I would not recommend this razor to anyone.",

The initial cut and closeness is fine but the blade block metal is either four times as hard as the foil(screen)or the tolerance is too tight. This in turns eats or tears a hole in the screen every 3-4 weeks. At over $37.00 a replacement set this sucks big time. I've e-mailed their customer service and was told that excessive pressure causes premature wear and set me a 10% off coupon, sounds like marketing and engineering got a bonus for this design. Funny that my brothers does the same thing! Buy this poor design at the risk of slicing your face with no warning or emptying your wallet every four weeks. I'll stick with the Brauns fixed blades from now on. Their block last two years and the foil close to one.",

I have to guess that CR tested it for a day or so, and the positive reviewers here wrote their reviews after a week or less.  The \"microscreen\" is incredibly flimsy.  Within 3 weeks, mine developed a slit that grew a little every day.  The blades underneath contact your skin through the slit, and hack you up like Freddy Krueger.  Then you need to replace the microscreens at $20 each.  It's a good razor while the screen lasts, but if you need to replace it every month at $20/each, why bother?",

The bottle is plastic, it arrived totally unsealed both outside the bottle, as well as inside the bottle.\n\nMy main complaint is that this in no way smells like lavender to me, much less French Lavender.  Iam not sure what could of happened, but had I been able to smell this beforehand, I would of passed on ordering it.  It is a lovely shade of purple, if purples your thing, and you aren't as particular when it comes to scent like Iam.\n\nTo me lavender and specifically French Lavender should smell a certain way.

It's not like a constant stream like you see in the commercials. Any pressure higher than 4 would cause the handle to shake and makes it hard to hold. Water also started leaking out from the handle. The water in the container won't last more than 10 seconds if you don't put it on the lowest pressure. The lower pressures don't even seem to make any difference..,might as well just throw some water in your mouth. For returns, they charge $10 and up. Overall, not worth it.",
            "I have been a long time Norelco shaver user.  When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor.  Big Mistake!  The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.\n\nWhy you say?  To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings.  In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads.  The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.\n\nBy the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.  You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after \"cleaning.\"\n\nThe bottom line:  In a failed attempt to make a quieter, faster, shaving system, Norelco actually made it WORSE than earlier lift-and-cut models.  Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  Do not waste your hard-earned cash on this sub-par Norelco product.",

The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!

            "Don't believe the hype. I got this because I was sick and tired of my hair stylist giving me flack for using Dove shampoo which, by the way, costs me around $4 and makes my hair look like a million bucks. I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP. I have virgin hair... I straighten my hair often and at the lowest heat setting... and this has never happened prior to switching to this shampoo. Returning. Hope this review helps. I'll stick to my $4 shampoo thank you very much.",

Not only does it fail to provide the superb moisturization that it used to do so superbly, but a few minutes after applying it, your hands feel even more dry than they had before. Not only have they removed the components of their formula that worked so well - probably due to manufacturing cost and a drive for profit - but they've greedily and figured out a way to make the consumer of the product use more and more of it in an attempt to achieve any effective moisturization at all. It's almost diabolical - you have to keep reapplying the stuff over and over, just to overcome the dryness that the product itself induces - even though the product was supposed to eliminate dryness in the first place.",
            "My brief experience with the T770 was similar to Mr. Ginsberg's. I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.\n\nNorelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770.\n\nIt looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.",

It used to be of a much higher quality and they have changed the the bleach and trays.\n\nThe trays:\nThey used to be a soft foam that really fit my teeth. The new style was made for people with very small teeth and are flimsy.\n\nThe bleach:\nThe gel bleach is not soft enough to spread evenly across all your teeth. This results in a very uneven bleaching and spotty results. I thought I could maybe spread it and use my custom trays but it's too think and won't spread. There's really no hope in getting even results.\n\nThis product is terrible and I will not be buying it again.",
            "I had a Philips Norelco 20XL which served great for 10 years until the guard comb eventually broke. Bought this one and hoped it would as good. No way! This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.\n1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.\n2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.\n3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!\n4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.\n5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.\n\nAwful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price. I would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one.",
            "It's a nice looking comb; however that's the only good thing about it. It's made of 100% plastic so it permanently bends which is not a big deal but since it is plastic it's not durable. A tooth broke within weeks. I have a very old Goodie brand comb that doesn't have broken teeth or is bent. For me, the best pocket combs have some rubber mixed in with the plastic so they don't break. Too bad this one was not that way because it was expensive for a small comb.",

            "I had bought a Conair brush years ago that I loved, however the ball tips finally started to fall out. It was nice, light and glided through my hair without any snags. I decided to try something different based on the reviews and I am so utterly disappointed in this brush! The first thing I noticed when taking this out of the box is how heavy it is. This brush definitely has some weight to it and is clunky to hold while brushing my long hair. I also have baby fine hair and the plastic silver looking  area that attaches the brush head to the handle catches it something fierce. It's practically guaranteed to snag and pull out a hair any time I use it. The only redeeming quality is that this brush doesn't look half bad. I received a blue one, which I can pass off to my brother who doesn't have to worry about any hair snagging.",
            "I did read reviews half good half bad but i didn't think it was THIS bad. The trays honestly refuse to stay in place. It took 2 tries for me to get them to stay in my mouth (by clenching my jaw for the 45 minutes of horror) To notice that after all of the gel slips and slides around (and out of the tray) that only HALF of my teeth were whiter after every use. Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don't look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don't eat after i use the trays. Over all I've gotten alo't more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle.",

On my last vacation I forgot the charging cord and it turned on in my suitcase so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.  I'm finally getting rid of this piece of junk today and I'm going to buy a different electric razor.",

First off, it's way too wide for the bikini area. It's hard to get it in the hip crease area. Second, I could not get this thing to trim any hairs at all. I compared the guard and it's the same length on the shortest setting as my old one. It has two blades going back and forth, just doesn't cut hair. It may work if you only trim once every several months, but do not buy this for general maintenance."

The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!  I've had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!",
            "Don't believe the hype. I got this because I was sick and tired of my hair stylist giving me flack for using Dove shampoo which, by the way, costs me around $4 and makes my hair look like a million bucks. I bought it because it was shipped and sold by Amazon.com so I wasn't worried about it being counterfeit. I am, however, worried about how this completely destroyed my hair. This pricy shampoo smelled awful, made my hair FALL OUT, and turned it into this dry and frizzy mess with absolutely no volume or shine. I'm so dissapointed. My usual full, shiny hair became limp and lifeless after just one wash :( Not cute.\n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to straighten my hair and make it look more manageable, a few hairs FRIED and COILED UP. I have virgin hair... I straighten my hair often and at the lowest heat setting... and this has never happened prior to switching to this shampoo. Returning. Hope this review helps. I'll stick to my $4 shampoo thank you very much.",

            "My brief experience with the T770 was similar to Mr. Ginsberg's. I bought it yesterday at Wal*Mart, charged it last night, and today while trying to adjust the trimming height (before using it for the first time) it came apart and I cannot get it back together. The problem is with the mechanism that raises and lowers the cutting head to adjust the cutting height. A small narrow strip of plastic slides up and down in a track to adjust the cutting height when the adjustment ring is turned. If this piece of plastic comes out of the track then it requires special tools and/or knowledge to get it back in.\n\nI bought the T770 to replace a T765 for which I had lost the charger. The cutting height adjustment mechanism on the T765 is more robustly designed and looks like it would not be susceptible to being easily removed or dislodged.\n\nNorelco took a step backward when they replaced the T765 with the T770.\n\nIt looks like ordering a replacement charger for my T765 will be worth the trouble after all.",

This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.\n1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.\n2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.\n3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!\n4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.\n5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.\n\nAwful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price. I would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one.",
            "It's a nice looking comb; however that's the only good thing about it. It's made of 100% plastic so it permanently bends which is not a big deal but since it is plastic it's not durable. A tooth broke within weeks. I have a very old Goodie brand comb that doesn't have broken teeth or is bent. For me, the best pocket combs have some rubber mixed in with the plastic so they don't break. Too bad this one was not that way because it was expensive for a small comb.",
            "I've had two of these, both of them \"died\" of the same cause.\n\nThe construction for the power button relies on a little sealed container and a plastic spike pressing on the button.\n\nIf air escapes the sealed container, the plastic spike is no longer in contact with the button. You then have to open the whole unit up to let some air back into the sealed container. Of course, doing this opening you risk breaking bits and pieces. It's not impossible, but definitely a design flaw.\n\nI first got one of these in 2006. A second in 2009. Both have \"failed\" in the same way.\n\nI do not recommend this model.",
            "This \"men's cutting system\" unfortunately has all the hallmarks of cheap Chinese-made junk toys. This can barely handle anything more than 5 o'clock shadow, and I don't recommend it. I bought mine a few months ago and I do not use it now, because it popped open while shaving and the head assembly was reduced to about a dozen parts. Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don't understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.",

Luckily the effect seems to fade (as in my teeth don't look as nice and shiny white as they do right after i remove the trays) by the time i wake up in the morning which i find rather odd considering i don't eat after i use the trays. Over all I've gotten alo't more results from using whitening mouthwashes for less of a hassle.",

I give them 1 star because I do feel that they did whiten my teeth better and faster then anything else I've used but the delivery system makes them unbearable and I'll never buy them again.\n\nTrays are to small, gel seeps out everywhere *GROSS*, I think I swallowed more then got on my teeth. I gagged and choked, you can't even open your mouth with these things in let alone TALK. So you have to be completely silent and spit out clumps of gel that seep out the entire 30-45 min. I don't even think I have to continue.\n\nTry \"American Fare\" from K-mart. They have the exact same solution as the Crest which all dentists recommend, they're $10 cheaper then the Aqua Fresh, and the trays are made of *wax* so they will mold to your teeth. (I always do the \"Primum 7 day\" who wants to use this stuff for 14 days anyway?)",
        "I can not use it.  Is is too wide.",
        "While cheap and plastic might work well in certain areas of Hollywood, it does not work for this organizer. I am not sure I could even re-gift this if it were given to me. It is smaller than expected. I will chalk that up to my inability to understand the dimensions. This is a dollar store piece of junk that I paid over $10 for. Save $9 and go to the dollar store.",
        "Wow!  I wish I had known the problems I would have with this lemon I would've made sure I took Norelco up on their satisfaction guarantee!  I have an old 5601X that works as well.  I expected quicker, closer shaves and it takes just as long.  The top pops open without warning and I'm sure the slots are smaller than my previous Norelcos so my whiskers don't get shaved as close nor as fast.  Gee!  Save your money and don't buy this puppy!  I've had at least four other Norelcos since I started shaving about forty years ago and this is the worst!",
        "Terrible cape. neck opening is way too large, and it has no weight so it doesn't lay flat, and it bunches up very easily. This is a dollar store quality item at beauty store prices. This wasted my money.",
        "The shampoo has the consistency of water, so you won't be able to hold enough in your hand to get it on your head.  Very disappointed!",
        "This product is too thick and does not blend well with my makeup.\nAnd it makes my pores on my face feel clogged. Not happy with it.\nCan I return it and get my money back?",
        "This is way too small to be considered a full body sea sponge. It's size is more suited to facial cleansing uses.  It also does not have a strong as depicted in the photo."

        "The product smells fantastic.  It's a lighter version of Pinaud Clubman which has that classic barber shop fragrance.  The seller promised to deliver by April 01 but it arrived on the 3rd.  Upon opening the box a portion of the contents had already spilled out.  I would suggest taping the screw top cap to the bottle as well.",
        "I love all things French Lavender as well as most products made in France, so this Pre de Provence Maison French Lavender Bath Salts should of been the perfect product for me.  Unfortunately it isn't!\n\nFirst of all, the cap to the bottle arrived dented in several places.  The bottle is plastic, it arrived totally unsealed both outside the bottle, as well as inside the bottle.\n\nMy main complaint is that this in no way smells like lavender to me, much less French Lavender.  Iam not sure what could of happened, but had I been able to smell this beforehand, I would of passed on ordering it.  It is a lovely shade of purple, if purples your thing, and you aren't as particular when it comes to scent like Iam.\n\nTo me lavender and specifically French Lavender should smell a certain way.  This doesn't!  French Lavender is my favorite scent, period.",

        "This is not a review for the wilkinson blades themselves, which are awesome (5 stars). I selected to purchase 100 blades for $18.95. The title above said 50ct. If I had received 50 I would have been ok with it (cost a bit higher than local, but saved me a trip to the store); however, I received 10 blades for $14.54. They sell locally for around $1.25 for a 5 pack. Two dollars fifty is no where near $14.54 and since it isn't what I signed up for, Kay Beauty: I will absolutely be returning these.",
        "The container to hold the product isn't the greatest. You have to push up the Chapstick like a push pop. The sides of the container were dirty with black fuzz when it arrived. Would like it better if the container was like a normal Chapstick.",

        "This might be a great comb.  I wouldn't know because I sent it back after opening the package and finding that my set of 2 combs I paid almost $20 for was really just one comb.  I hope whoever helped themselves to the other comb from the package will give it a positive review to balance out might disgruntled review.",
        "I got my hopes up reading all these reviews and bought this expecting a hassle-free experience. Oh boy, how wrong was I.\n\nFirst of all, this waterpik has tons of water leaking through the base. Upon closer examination I found out the hose attachment near the bottom of the waterpik has a crack already- and I haven't even used it once! OMFG\n\nThen there's the non-functional on/off switch. It's forever stuck at the on position and I cannot get it to rest at the off position. *facepalm* Defective product is defective. Seller won't refund or exchange any opened merchandise, so good fight to me. Looks like I lost $60 for this POS.",

This was not clearly stated at the time of purchase and not written in the specifications.  Also, my order originated from the Amazon Au site and was transferred to Amazon.com to place my order.  Therefore I am very unhappy with my purchase because it does not work here in Australia or I now have to purchase a power converter unit to be able to use.",
        "Here again I have to give one star as the box that the powder came in was opened. Powder was awful, very strong order and very overpowering. Can't use it. Also the container that the powder was in didn't have the plastic thing that has the holes in it to regulate how much powder comes up from the bottom and gets on the puff.",
        "First they said they delivered it, but never got it. So they gave me a credit back. Then a week later post office said they had my package. Went and got it, contacted company they said they could not charge me again. They said I had to contact you. I have tried many times with you but still not able to pay them. The biggest problem is with usps have had nothing but problems with them, lkast 4 or 5 orders with them they keep saying they delivered the packages but I never got them, and days later the packages they said I recieved mysteriously end up at thier office and have to go pick them up. If i order from amazoned again and find out thye are using usps for delivery I will cancel order I want nothing to to with them, just this one order have spent hours trying to reslove this and am getting very fustrated."
