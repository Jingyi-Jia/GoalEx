    "You cant print off of SVG images. Or ask it to print anything for that matter unless it is an image that is on a proprietary \"Circut\" cartridge.  The expense of this along is well over $3000 if you were to buy the cartridges at a DISCOUNTED price!\n\nNext major issue is that it requires 'sticky' mats to cut.  which works great for the cutting... not so much for getting your project off of said mat.\n\nOverall, there are better products that offer more options and cost less. Especially long term.",
    "this was not at all what I expected.  It is a stiff dial that you have to turn manually...but be careful not to turn it too far past the number (sometimes it doesn't even stop on a number).  Not useful at all.  There are times I am knitting and look down to see it has moved to in between 2 numbers.  Horrible product :(",
    "the product might be good, however, it never arrived.",
    "So not worth it. I regret this buy. I would get something else if I could do it over again.",
    "I just got back into sewing and thought this would be a great purchase. Its about 3 months after the fact and I just bought another pin holder because this one was so hard to manage. The product is exactly as advertised and fine for the price but it is really useless in my opinion. You would have to use one hand to hold the tomato and the other to put in each individual pin. Its so light that it would slide around all over the place if you tried putting a pin in without holding it. I just bought the Dritz Magnetic Pin Caddy and its so much more amazing. Think about skipping the tomato and getting this one instead. It will save you some frustration.",
    "Half were broken\nHalf had sticky worn off\nJunk",
    "Please notice how old all the 5 star ratings are on this item.  Totally NOT worth the money for my Brother PE770 Embroidery Machine.  When this hit the market nearly 10 years ago, it was fine.  Today?  If you have an embroidery machine that takes a USB thumb/flash drive, don't buy this because you don't need it.  There are tons of freebie embroidery software on the internet that you can save to your laptop and transfer to a USB thumb drive.  All this does is allow you to minimally edit existing designs and then transfer them to the machine.  It does NOT resize large images down to your hoop size, or digitize images like .jpg or .gif so you can embroider those images.  It does NOT allow you to create text to embroider.  The software looks like it was written for Windows 98.  And with the memory size of thumb drives today, you really don't need that great big card either.  Save your money.",
    "Blades are not sharp.  Does not make a clean \"clip\".  Not recommended",
    "not good quality at all, they don't even spread around all that much when you add water, and the mark stays no matter how light it is. youd be better off just spending the money on a prismacolor watercolor pencil set. don't waste your money.",
    "I bought this as I thought it was like my old one bought in the UK. However I was very disappointed to find you can not rotate to get to the back of your work. I had a friend add a couple of pieces of wood and drill for another bolt which now allows me to turn it by loosening the knob, but overall I was very disappointed. The quality is ok but not practical to work on without modification.",
    "Won't even use these. Too many bristles fall out. Not durable at all.",
    "brush looks nothing like this, it has a cheap poorly shaped tip, disappointing purchase.",
    "It is just what it says ECONOMY yarn, cheap but poor quality in my opinion.",
    "What a waste of money, buying this product.",
    "I didn't like them because they were too short.  If they would have been longer they would have won my heart.\n\nAfter a month or two of not using them, I gave them away.",
    "This brush only lasted through one model kit. I was not impressed one bit. Most of the hair has fallen out. I have a $4.00 chinese knock off that is way better than this. Would not recommend.",
    "Beautiful hook. Was so excited to get it. Couldn't wait to use it, but as soon as I opened the package I noticed that the mouth and neck slope are not condusive for crocheting. The opening of the hook is so tight/small it won't accept the worsted weight yarn I have much less a bulkier weight yarn. And the edges are rough, snag the yarn. This hook is beautiful but absolutely NOT FUNCTIONAL. This is more suited for a decorative item. Very disappointed. Calling to see if I can return it and get my money back.",
    "Very pretty, not well made. These hooks simply don't work. They miss yarn overs, split the yarn and the throat is so narrow only the smallest thread will fit! I have had to carve and sand them extensively with a dremel just to try to salvage this purchase.",
    "I would have posted a pic but somebody else already did, showing the same problem... Half the reason I bought this stencil was for the cool spiral swirls, but unlike the product picture, it has these weird round spots and are all disconnected. I do not like the \"spirals\" AT ALL on the stencil I actually received.\n\nI would have given another star or two because the rest looks okay and the plastic isn't too flimsy, but I feel LIED TO for receiving something different from what I ordered.",
    "I guess you get what you pay for.. this was definitely a cheapo item, and would have been better paying more for something better.",
    "I recently ordered 2 packages of this item. I have only opened one so far, and am very disappointed. I have used both of the mats in the package. The first full page of cuts worked great. The mat held the paper. By the second piece, the paper kept slipping. After repeated tries, I finally gave up and went to the second mat which was nice and sticky being new. I am now having the paper slip again. I am contacting the company to get them replaced. I asked Amazon if they could have been old stock. They assured me that they were brand new.",
    "Ripoff",
    "Never worked.",
    "Disappointing selection of colours and 2 were damaged. Would love to send the pictures but not sure how",
    "This simply does not work. Used regular hand sewing needles just like it suggests,",
    "sadly. I like Clover Chalk...but this one came in a lot of tiny pieces...making it unusable. Amazon did refund quickly!",
    "I design, make, and sell jewelry for a living.  Some of the jewelry I make is crocheted, requiring a button to be used as part of the clasp.  I purchased this item thinking I'd have a nice supply of miscellaneous buttons to use for clasps.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nMost of the buttons I received were filthy.  Many were scratched up and had chips missing from them, showing signs of obvious wear.  I even received several that had BRAND NAMES on them.  If I had used a button with a brand name on it for any of my jewelry pieces, I'd have been putting myself in a position to be sued for copyright infringement, along with other trademark-related crimes.\n\nAfter sorting through the buttons, my hands were so covered in dust, dirt, and filth from the buttons themselves, I had to scrub them with soap and hot water.  I promptly placed all the buttons back into the bucket and hit up a customer service representative to set up a return.  I was disgusted that Amazon would send out such a disgusting product (as my order WAS through Amazon directly).  Thankfully, the customer service rep handled the situation very well.  I wouldn't recommend wasting your money if you want to actually use these in crafting apparel or jewelry.  Or if you plan on receiving new buttons.  Or clean buttons.  Or anything of even marginal quality.",
    "The mats received are not as pictured. Anyone familiar to Cricut knows the difference between the original mat and the new which has bad reviews for stickiness. I was disappointed not to receive what was pictured as I have been happy with those. Shipping was expensive too.",
    "Boyfriend bought this for me well over a year ago. Used it once. Have attempted to use it several times since and every time I remember why it was put away. The wing nuts hurt like heck to tighten, and the dowels are cut to where other does NOT hold fabric right on the middle. When you try to tighten, the fabric just slips out in the middle regardless of what you do. Would love to get back to two handed stitching...",
    "I ordered a few different yarns from red heart, since i loved using them before. Sadly this time when i used them, the package was stolen off my porch and they refused to give me a refund or to resend me the yarn I ordered. Very disappointing.",
    "THIS ARRIVED IN VERY POOR CONDITION. THE CHALKS WERE ALL CRACKED AND LOOKED OLD. I'VE PURCHASED OTHERS OF THIS BRAND AND THEY WERE FIND, BUT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE PASTELS AT THIS TIME.",
    "Buyer beware.  The photo for this item shows the thicker oil pastels.  I thought that was what I was ordering.  The pastels arrived, but they are about half the thickness of the other pastels.  Compare their photo to the photo of the actual product.  My daughter used a few of them already so unfortunately I cannot return the item.",
    "Misleading... i thought i was buying metal knitting needles... I cannot stand false or misleading advertising. It's about as bad as selling a \"steem\" cleaner which doesn't produce steam to shampoo carpet and taking advantage of customers.\n\nThe seller was awesome..\n\nBut the Susan Bates Company ought to be reprimanded for misleading it's customers with the name of the knitting needle. I don't care if it said or not plastic anywhere-  i have a problem with the title bc it immediately misleads the person into not checking if the knitting needle is actually made of metal rather than plastic. Plastic has more friction resistance, which is probably nice for beginners, but not for fast knitters.\n\nThe length of the needle for english style knitting is perfect",
    "Opened package to find yarn had been cut in several places",
    "Nothing I use stuck.  I tried some appliqu&eacute;s, then my wife tried them, but despite several tries nothing we tried stuck.  Maybe it's meant for big stuff and all of our attempts were 2-4\" in size.",
    "It did not meet my expectations.  I was expecting a light shade of coral.  It was nice and soft though.",

    "This crochet hooks were highly rated, for the most part, and that is the reason I purchased them.  It seemed like a good value at the time.  However, these hooks snag on my yarn and are not well made. There are sharp-ish edges , which is not good for crocheting.  They scratch my hands as I try to use them and even my kids don't like them.  I have been using the Susan Bates silvalume hooks, which have a bamboo handle. They are much more comfortable to use and I don't feel fatigued in my hand nearly as quickly.  I plan to make my next purchases an even higher quality hook, like the ones made by Furls.",
    "Plastic parts.  Stopped sewing after 6 months.  Will never own another Brother product.",
    "i typically love this brand of brushes.  the brushes in the 1177 set shed like crazy.  i used the brushes for art (acrylic paintings) and the white nylon is always perfect while these were a disappointment with all the constant fibers that end up on the canvas.  ugh",
    "I received this ruler and very unhappy because of the scratched on some corners... :(",
    "Really unhappy with the item, and ordered 6! Ah well... My mistake.\nNot sure what I'll do with the stuff, since it won't work for the grand children's footy pjs!\nTerribly stiff and just a waste for my intended application.",
    "Ceap7",
    "I have order this product several times.  The last two times I have ordered it, I was very disappointed. There were broken beads and things in it I don't even know what they were.  I will not order from them again",
    "I paid almost eight dollars I believe then I saw them at Michael's for $1. I would have returned them but unfortunately, in a rush, I cut the tags off. They are very thin material and flimsy.",
    "I should have just went to michaels",
    "This barely works on thing, single layer fabric. On any thick or layered fabrics It won't work- the plastic fasteners break and fall off upon pushing the button down. This is not like the original buttoner that came out well over 30 years ago.",
    "these did not work at all.  after application and ironing, they left a pattern on the fabric from decal not attaching fully or properly to the fabric.  tried all the sheets, no luck with any.  save your money, don't purchase",
    "Do not like this. Is not what I thought I was ordering from the descriptioml",
    "I'm very disappointed.  Had these on my 9\" circular needles size 1 and thought they were snug.  Not so much.  They popped off and I had to frog 20 rounds of lace knitting for my socks.  Not a happy camper.  I'll be putting these in the circular file.",
    "I don't like them. They look weird!",
    "This was almost a joke, it is practically made of paper. I bought mine thru Jo-ann fabrics for Clearance for under $3. and I still don't think it was worth the money.  It is so tiny ( I would say it would be fine for a child )something I would expect to see in the local dollar store.  The picture is so deceiving, it looks like tough burlap material and it is more like a heavy brown paper bag with a plastic coating on the inside.",
    "I must be missing something. My friend gave me this glue to try.....she used it a lot for scrapbooking I presume. I'm not a scrapbooker, but do a lot of other crafts. This glue held absolutely nothing together for me.....NOTHING! I have tried it on several types of materials.....reindeer moss to objects, small polymer clay pieces, tiny tiny wood materials to eachother and even paper and so much more and I have to say I have never been so baffled as to how a product can be so popular and not even be able to hold 2 pieces of paper together.\n\nThe above experiment was a couple yrs ago. I was recently in walmart and saw turbo tacky glue and thought well maybe that will be better then my last experience.......mmmmm no.... same results.....I find these glues absolutely useless.",
    "I though this would work for my Filo Fax but it did not. This is the diary size which in my excitement I did not read. But if it wasn't for that I would totally rate this a 5 star. But alas I will probably never get to use this because I don't use anything this size.",
    "First these are not really washable markers. They say on the packkage that they will not wash off walls or clothing. They will only wash off whiteboards or other similiar 'washable' surfaces and skin. But worse than that is the crayons just fall apart. When you try to sharpen them they just crumble. If you peel back the paper, they just fall apart. And the colors do not show up well on the included board. This is a really bad product.",
    "These worked great, long enough to cut out a pattern. They started to stick, the spring would not open the blades all the way. I cont to cut with them hoping it would resolve itself. Never did so returned for a replacement. I hope they work, as these are the best scissors I've ever used, as far as cutting fabric.",
    "My yarn kept slipping out of the loop and the ring would not stay on my finger. There is absolutely no way to adjust the size of this either. I was so excited when I saw it but it was a waste of money and I broke the ring in the process of trying to make it smaller to fit my finger",
    "Did not adhere to fabric and I resorted to regular Elmers glue...so disappointing....",
    "Shredded the shirt as it crumbled apart. Absolutely terrible! Don't waste your money.",
    "Perhaps this is a good product. If you buy it I recommend buying in store so you can see it first. Each time I've ordered it has arrived with the corner chipped off which to me makes it subpar quality.",
    "My main complaint is that the sticks holding the beads fall very easily out of the slots. This would be a very useable product if there was some type of way the stringing pins locked into the rack so that they could not move around. Otherwise, this is useless.",
    "I ordered because it stated it was light grey. It's more silver and does not match a light grey I was already working with.",
    "The first set came with beat up box, and I was just shocked to find that the art supplies inside had been used and then stuffed back inside especially the chock every piece of chalk had been used until it was just a little nub of chalk left. And then somebody had the nerve to put it all back in there and try to sell it. The paintbrushes were broken, the box itself was broken, the packaging is the worst problem that they happen I have contacted and dandy the store that sells these, and made some recommendations because it can't be that hard to make it so that the art supplies don't come broken and In pieces, when my replacement set came, I was excited because after all I wanted the set. But then again the top shelf of things were jumbled all over the place the paints all had the lids off everything was jumbled all over, the oil crayons or rather oil pastel crayons were broken although they were complete whereas the first set they were used the second set they were just broken. The paintbrushes in the second that were broken as well as the first set I believe that all could be fixed by taking a look at the packaging. I won't ever get another set like this from this company.",
    "I just bought one of those cute adult coloring books and was in between pencils and markers. Bought these and they seemed dry. Very uneven color, hated them.",
    "When I received this, I was expecting more than just one (1) in the package, as when I looked at the picture, there was more than just one (1) in the package.",
    "I have bought this yarn previously (Aran) and was satisfied.  I recently bought two skein and found them totally flawed.  Consistanly varied as to the width, the twist and one skein was knotted twice.  I will never again purchase Red Heart 4 ply again.  Where was the quality control?\nOn to another brand.\n\nMilli",
    "hammer part is fine, but had to sand the handle just to use.  Part of the handle was not even lacquered and the part that was has large bits of something green stuck into it as well as smaller black bits of something that is very hard and jagged making it very unpleasant to even hold the hammer on ones hand.",
    "don't like it at all",
    "I have no idea as this was a gift to a kid who never told me anything about how she liked/disliked it --sigh kids!",
    "I bought this bias maker by mistake; thought it would fit my Simplcity bias maker. That should be made clear to shoppers.",
    "I bought this for needle punch work. I really hoped it would hold my work as well as a gripper frame. Not even close. I was hoping as the Morgans come in a variety if sizes. Maybe for embroidery it would be ok, but I do NOT like it for needle punch.",
    "This was bought for my Dad, who has been doing a LOT of the adult paint by number paintings lately.  I knew he would not spend this much for a brush and I wanted to get him a nice one since he is wearing out the ones that comes with the pictures and they often aren't small enough to do some of the thin line areas.  I had bought him a set for about half the price of this brush that had 00 brushes.  After hundreds of hours of painting they would no longer hold a point so I thought this would be a great surprise for him.  Boy was it a surprise he thought he had this great brush and in less than 5 minutes it started fuzzing up and he tried all the usual stuff but he could not get it back to a point.  He said if I reviewed it to give it a negative 5 stars.  Couldn't do that so it's getting a one star.  Hope this helps someone else from wasting their money.  Sad thing is his sister taught art for years and paints and twenty years ago bought a brush for $20 that she still uses so he knows a good one should last.",
    "It was referred to me by a friend and since it was on sale, I went for it. I don't like it at all. I prefer Sulky brand. This brand leaves \"poop\" all over the back when you try to peel it off. Sulky brands pull off very clean. Uggghhh and there is such a huge amount of this to use.",
    "This is worst yarn I've ever bought. Instead of the strands being together it's like working with four separate thin strands. This happened with two different colors. I'll never buy this yarn from Amazon again!  I'd give it zero stars if i could!!",
    "I called red heart and complained about the inferior quality of this yarn.  Red heart apologized and I am waiting for a new supply of it to come to market",
    "They did not work",
    "This clay is not good. Not firm at all and when it starts warming up in your hand and you try to make detail. Good luck, go with a firm clay and save yourself the headache.",
    "I bought one  after reading the good reviews  well  it was a lemon and returned it for an exchange that one was a lemon as well .so returned it  we get what we pay for how true .  this was quite a few months ago and just recently someone gave me and older brothers sewing machine  it even is made out of metal ,much nicer machine and does so much more  .and it works !!",
    "Unfortunately my needles were not in the best of shape. The #2 tip were bent and I couldn't even get my #4's on the cable because they were bent. I was able to fix them well enough to use but I was very disappointed.",
    "The picture is totaly differant than what I received, will have to use it due have project to complete now. Love Red Heart products but the picture does not correspond with the actual product.",
    "This yarn is SUPER scratchy & likes to unravel itself when trying to crochet it.",
    "Just don't, it's so hard to deal with, I went out and bought a binder",
    "I want to ask people interested in sable brushes (no matter which brand) to please consider synthetic sable instead because the hair used in these brushes is gotten by extremely cruel means. Please research this for yourselves. Thank you.",
    "I thought these were a good deal until I unfortunately discovered they are not solid sterling as described. They're fake. I spent quite a bit of time looking thru different sellers to find the best deal. I wasted my time and money on these. Move on and don't waste a single second on these. There's nothing worse than being misled and ripped off.\nThe really sad thing is that this these are a low dollar item. A seller destroyed their reputation with me, and anyone else who reads this, for almost nothing. They sold their reputation for less than $3. Just a sorry thing.",
    "I was expecting, as it said.. to have some grip to the plastic to hold the template from moving when on the fabric while I am rotary cutting it..... but..it does nothing to keep the template from moving when on the fabric. Template slides like it did without it. I am not happy with this product..it doesn't do what it says. Now, it does keep the templates from sliding around when they are stacked together...template to template. That is a tad of help since when I use several size templates, and they are sliding all over..this product makes them kind of stick together so they don't get pushed around and have to hunt for them. But it is advertised to hold the template to the fabric..and it doesn't",
    "I paid for 100 and got maybe 30. These are ultra micro, but there is no way there are 100 in this bag.",
    "I did finally get a chance to use it. I'm allergic to it and it smells toxic. Not to mention for a glaze it does not work.",
    "All pans where broken to dust not happy returning",
    "I'm very upset because I bought this product easy cast and I got pour-on. I already started a project with easy cast and I was short so I but one more and I got something else...no I cannot finish it or I have to buy again. I am no like to return products and I stuck with it but Amazon should have more careful with vendors",
    "Thin, colos light, not good for projects, disappointing",
    "I've used Fiskars punches for years so when my new craft required a bigger trimmer I felt safe getting a Fiskars brand one.  After using it for only 2 crafting sessions, I am disappointed that the blade does not stay in the track.  I rarely make it threw one swipe before the blade comes out somewhere along the plastic guide, not just at the blade changing section.  It has created the groove on the base to have cut marks on it's sides b/c it doesn't stay in the plastic flip up ruler guide so even if it does a full cut it isn't straight.\n\nSadly I would not buy this again and I recommend you don't spend your money on it either.  I'm chalking it up to a waste of money and am on the hunt for a new paper trimmer.  Does anyone have an suggestions on a good quality paper trimmer?",
    "I cannot use this yarn. It started to shred as soon as I tried to cast off.",
    "Very pretty, not well made. These hooks simply don't work. They miss yarn overs, split the yarn and the throat is so narrow only the smallest thread will fit! I have had to carve and sand them extensively with a dremel just to try to salvage this purchase.",
    "Very small and expensive, I returned it. Good old food coloring work just as good. The only color that would be difficult to create would be amber but for the price of this small bottle, no amber for me.\nSeller performance was fine, but I would not recommend this product as it is just expensive food color.",
    "Didn't like",
    "Not great. My pins wouldn't stay in the middle of the magnet. They slid to the sides almost falling off. I removed the magnets and made my own pin keeper with a glass plate.",
    "Ceap7",
    "Yarn",
    "Product came with missing pair",
    "These are very cheaply made. I can't even use them.  Waste of money.",
    "I enjoyed using the pencils until they needed sharpening. The lead breaks every time I sharpen them, leaving the pencil useless. Will not recommend purchase.",
    "If I could leave 0 stars I would do so. Yes, these brushes come at a cheap price, but they are so cheaply made that it took 3 brushes to complete a single piece of wooden trim that measured 8ft long and 3in wide. I was using polyshade stain, and it literally took 3 brushes!!! Really... in the end, it costs more to use them!",
    "A great brush but I received it in poor quality. Tip was already ruined. Maybe I was unlucky.",
    "It was referred to me by a friend and since it was on sale, I went for it. I don't like it at all. I prefer Sulky brand. This brand leaves \"poop\" all over the back when you try to peel it off. Sulky brands pull off very clean. Uggghhh and there is such a huge amount of this to use.",
    "Soapy paint. Not useful for project when using spatula is needed. Mostly for small pieces with fine brushes.",
    "Bought this to use with the webcaster. Unable to use it because the material stuck to the house and when I try to remove it, it took the paint off the house",
    "I was a loyal, and I mean LOYAL buyer of this product for so many years I can't count. I've been scrapbooking for 20 years. Tombow changed their permanent adhesive maybe 2 years ago, and it was never the same. I would create a page and the next day, everything had popped up. It did NOT stick. I was sooooooooo disappointed. My Tombow items I made over 10 years ago are still intact but the new ones? Nope. I contacted the company numerous times and never received a response, which was disheartening. I've heard the same complaints from long-time users as well. Now, I haven't bought one in well over a year now, so maybe they've improved it back to the original formula. I hope so because this one is pathetic.",
    "Not what I expected. Somehow I assumed this green was going to be rich, clear and super green. The color I got was a yucky, milky, pale green. Super disappointed! Still on the lookout for a rich deep green.",
    "awful and terribly weak",
    "it said it's washable, but it is not really. We washed the cover of  cushions with its stain on the same day, but it came out with little bit of , but very noticable stains after washing.  Very disappointing !",
    "Just sharpen the blade that you have... why buy another?",
    "Came to me completely destroyed, bottle open, all over inside of box. Wasn't even enough left to scrape up and put in a teaspoon.",
    "So short you may as well use your fingers!\nTotal disappointment and a huge waste of money :(\nmade my own from ballpoint stick pens - faster , easier and more comfortable to hold!",
    "Does not print very well. I ordered 2 because you only get 5 per package. Expensive for what you get especially with the poor quality. I have a high end printer so I know that is not the issue. I will not order again.",
    "These do not work as well as the original black and grey scissors. Very disappointed.",
    "Very disappointed. This is one of my most needed pencils and the first time I sharpened it, it cracked down the middle. Was not worth $10. I am so upset I just wasted my money and now my artwork will be behind.",
    "It's really unfortunate that when I bought this, three color pods were missing from it. If I want to send it back, I need to pay back shipping, and really, what's the point of throwing more money at the issue?!",
    "Glue arrived dried into a solid chunk in the bottle.  Completely useless.",
    "Arrived damaged!",
    "This machine is not worth the money!  I refuse to teach students wanting to learn to sew on it as it and the next model price higher have too many limitations.",
    "My niece sent this to me to attempt to correct the problem.  The stitch selector is jammed and doesn't budge. From searching for solutions after removing what plastic covering I could manage, I discovered plastic gears which are probably fused. This jamming is apparently a common problem.  Over the past 35 years I have collected older machines, and I will likely give her one that has metal gears....one you would be hard pressed to break, even if you tried.\nDon't bother with the new lightweight plastic covered, plastic geared machines. Go to second hand stores and yard/garage sales and get a real sewing machine that is heavy with metal throughout....without the computer bells and whistles and selective stitches over 8 or 10. If you can find one with cams, even better.\nIt's the presser feet that are the actual tools you need to invest in with the basic straight and zig zag stitch machine.\n\nKenmore 1341 8 stitch is a work horse. See also online auctions or sales.",
    "I would not recommend this product.  It breaks very easily.  And i can't figure out how to fix it.  Initially it worked fine and I loved it.  But after a few tries the tape broke.  To bad it seems like it would be a great product.",
    "I had high hopes for this - I like the clear inkjet film except that it is virtually impossible to get it to stick to ceramics or glass.  The adhesive version sticks OK, but the ink does not completely dry, not even after 24 hours.  Once you rub it the ink starts coming off.  I also tried putting an acrylic coat over it and all that happened was it caused the ink to run (this was after 24 hours of drying time).

    "I would highly recommend you proceed with caution buying these as chances are if you're purchasing from the main page lowest price \"buy box\" these are not 925 sterling silver, maybe plated, but nothing more.\n\nWhen the listing was originally created by Finding King they were selling genuine sterling silver, as FK is a highly reputable dealer. Along comes overseas dealers with faux 925, jumped onto the listing, priced them significantly lower and won the buy box as a result..which is what you're seeing now.\n\nWith a precious metal- a good rule to follow is if it seems to good to be true, it is. Precious metals cost the same per gram no matter what country you buy from. China does not have some magical precious metal cost the rest of the world does not, they just tend to have very low standards when it comes to product integrity and have no issue selling fakes. Chinese wholesale sites are flooded with fake stamped metal findings and most sellers will even tell you it is not 925 SS if you inquire.\n\nIf you are looking for real Sterling silver, my advice is to buy from a reputable dealer. Ask questions \"will this metal electronically or acid test as SS?\". Magnets are not fully reliable as findings often have parts that can not be manufactured with precious metal (inner workings of clasps, etc) . If you click on \"other sellers\" and scroll through you should be able to find the original seller with authentic findings.",

I've noticed my escoda reserva splits, but only with lower degrees of water in the brush. When saturated it's perfect, but as the water is removed it splits. But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.\n\nWith all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.\n\nDo yourself a favor, get a da vinci.

    "So... I started crochet with the cheap plastic hooks several years ago and then took a break. A few months ago I started going amigurumi (small crochet animals) crazy and then all of a sudden my hooks start breaking. So I began to hunt for something better. I tried the Susan Bates Silvalume Crochet Hooks in the Pouch (Sizes F-K). I took them home and tried them out on a current project - the one that had the broken hook, and I had such a difficult time finding a rhythm - these hooks were not polished enough and kept catching on the yarn.\nI then tried the Boye Aluminum Crochet Hook set - same thing - they kept catching on the yarn.\n\nI spoke to a store employee and she said that I should try wood - bamboo - both wood and plastic hooks are warmer than the aluminum and glide better. She was correct. I did like the bamboo hooks.\n\nAt this time I also bought a Tulip Etimo Crochet Hook - which, though aluminum, glided so smoothly through my yarn I was EXTREMELY pleased by it.\nI also tried the Clover Takumi Getaway Soft Touch Crochet Hooks Gift Set - and it too was amazing. I believe this is because the quality of the aluminum and the craftsmanship is so much better than the Boye and Susan Bates ones.\n\nConclusion: If you're beyond the plastic beginner stage - invest in some quality hooks.",

I usually buy my brushes when they go on sale for half off so at my local art store, a brush usually costs me about 5$. So when I finally broke down and spent the money on one of these I was pretty excited to see how it would perform. In one word \"Terrible\"! It is by far the worst brush I have ever used and DOES NOT hold a point at all. I spent more time trying to just get this brush to hold a decent point for inking than actually inking. So frustrating to have heard so many people praising the Series 7 as the best brush around and then come to find out a size zero brush is only good for blocking in sections of black and is useless for detailed line work, that makes no sense at all.

There are so many good reviews here, maybe the ones I bought have been on the shelf for a while (makes sense since they are twice the amount of fiskars and with fiskars you get 48 pens, this package was only 12 pens so they probably do not move as fast) So, truly, even if they ran great, and didn't run out, the colors are not so impressive that I would make the same mistake again.",

On one of the dispensers, I was able to straighten the tape, but it wouldn't wind properly (I had to use a screw driver to manually wind it - a big waste of my time.) With a new dispenser, I am able to do straight line gluing only; I don't use it for going around curved shapes - problem solved, huh?\n\nI will never buy this product again, no matter how sticky it may be!

It was like using water to glue....waste of money and fabric as it stained the fabric I tried it on so money wasted there as well!!!  The company should be ashamed of themselves!",
    "This paper trimmer leaves a ragged edge on all the paper I try to cut. I bought this \"used like new\" but did expect a better cut since it was so highly rated. I contacted the manufacturer and purchased a new cutting assembly for $14.99 but this only improved the cut marginally. I would not recommend this paper trimmer, I feel like I wasted my money.",
    "I have had this item for almost two months.  It is suddenly un-treading itself via the needle every time I use it.  I have checked the tension in bobbin and ensured it is properly set at the top.  What use is a sewing machine that does not sew.  When this happened it was to late to return it.  I will take it to a Singer dealer to see if it can be repaired.  I bought it for portable use and cannot use.  Very dissatisfied.",

The left side works perfectly every time, but the right side always, always catches the zipper with the thread and causes me to have to pick the thread out.

My pricey babylock is worth me being more careful.  So sadly, this Steam-A-Seasm isn't going to be used by me again.",

The bottle has little to no instructions - just \"Shake well. Stencil, brush, sponge, or stipple.\" There were no directions on how long to leave on the stencil, the medium, whether or not the final product could be washed, how to care for it...the list goes on and on.  When I logged on to the company website, there was not much more in the way of instruction.  I ended up scrapping the project because I didn't have enough time before the big event to buy something else to try.  Very disappointing!",

The product I received was hideous - she looked like a monster that had fake boobs. Scary and vulgar. This product might be just perfect for someone drawing superheroes and the like. But it should not be presented as natural-looking. I'm one of several who made this comment - why is the vendor not updating the product photo?\nAlso, paying $5 shipping plus $9 return shipping was super-annoying.\nPS. If it weren't for the false photo, I would give this 3-4 stars. Not because I would order it ever, but because the joints are moveable and it actually seems to be decent quality, in a quality package.",
    "I finished my smaller bottle of Armour Etch \"New and Improved.\" I had ordered 3 cases of bottles that I planned to frost and design. I had no problem with the coverage with Armour Etch \"new and improved\".\nThe reviews were good for this Armour Etch (not \"new improved\") so I got a large bottle. It is a terrible product. It left streaks from lack of coverage on my new expensive bottles. Some had hand made designs that couldn't be duplicated. I attempted to re-coat those with simple designs. I had to cover all of the area I had done before to prevent botching and I left this Armour Etch on for 20 minuted to be sure of an even coat. I rinsed and it still did not cover areas. It still left ugly streaks of \"frosted vs clear\" areas. I can not recommend this product unless you are only planning a tiny, tiny area. It \"may\" work for that. Not only was this was a total waste of money but it also ruined 4 new bottles which I am most unhappy about!\nThank you Amazon for refunding my money!",

    "This was bought for my Dad, who has been doing a LOT of the adult paint by number paintings lately.  I knew he would not spend this much for a brush and I wanted to get him a nice one since he is wearing out the ones that comes with the pictures and they often aren't small enough to do some of the thin line areas.  I had bought him a set for about half the price of this brush that had 00 brushes.  After hundreds of hours of painting they would no longer hold a point so I thought this would be a great surprise for him.  Boy was it a surprise he thought he had this great brush and in less than 5 minutes it started fuzzing up and he tried all the usual stuff but he could not get it back to a point.  He said if I reviewed it to give it a negative 5 stars.  Couldn't do that so it's getting a one star.  Hope this helps someone else from wasting their money.  Sad thing is his sister taught art for years and paints and twenty years ago bought a brush for $20 that she still uses so he knows a good one should last."

They scratch my hands as I try to use them and even my kids don't like them.  I have been using the Susan Bates silvalume hooks, which have a bamboo handle.

Now, it does keep the templates from sliding around when they are stacked together...template to template.

After using it for only 2 crafting sessions, I am disappointed that the blade does not stay in the track.  I rarely make it threw one swipe before the blade comes out somewhere along the plastic guide, not just at the blade changing section.  It has created the groove on the base to have cut marks on it's sides b/c it doesn't stay in the plastic flip up ruler guide so even if it does a full cut it isn't straight.\n\nSadly I would not buy this again and I recommend you don't spend your money on it either.

I contacted the company numerous times and never received a response, which was disheartening. I've heard the same complaints from long-time users as well.

Go to second hand stores and yard/garage sales and get a real sewing machine that is heavy with metal throughout....without the computer bells and whistles and selective stitches over 8 or 10. If you can find one with cams, even better.\nIt's the presser feet that are the actual tools you need to invest in with the basic straight and zig zag stitch machine.\n\nKenmore 1341 8 stitch is a work horse.

I have da vinci (series 10, 11, 35) and they are BY FAR SUPERIOR and most importantly CONSISTENT. I'm returning my series 7 for another series 11 da vinci. I've noticed my escoda reserva splits, but only with lower degrees of water in the brush. When saturated it's perfect, but as the water is removed it splits. But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.\n\nWith all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.\n\nDo yourself a favor, get a da vinci.

What's the use of a paper cutter that's tearing paper?

Other people have left reviews here on amazon saying that there is poor customer service.  Poor customer service wouldn't matter with a high quality product.

        "So... I started crochet with the cheap plastic hooks several years ago and then took a break. A few months ago I started going amigurumi (small crochet animals) crazy and then all of a sudden my hooks start breaking. So I began to hunt for something better. I tried the Susan Bates Silvalume Crochet Hooks in the Pouch (Sizes F-K). I took them home and tried them out on a current project - the one that had the broken hook, and I had such a difficult time finding a rhythm - these hooks were not polished enough and kept catching on the yarn.\nI then tried the Boye Aluminum Crochet Hook set - same thing - they kept catching on the yarn.\n\nI spoke to a store employee and she said that I should try wood - bamboo - both wood and plastic hooks are warmer than the aluminum and glide better. She was correct. I did like the bamboo hooks.\n\nAt this time I also bought a Tulip Etimo Crochet Hook - which, though aluminum, glided so smoothly through my yarn I was EXTREMELY pleased by it.\nI also tried the Clover Takumi Getaway Soft Touch Crochet Hooks Gift Set - and it too was amazing. I believe this is because the quality of the aluminum and the craftsmanship is so much better than the Boye and Susan Bates ones.\n\nConclusion: If you're beyond the plastic beginner stage - invest in some quality hooks.",

        "I have always heard about how awesome these are for inking and watercolor, which are my two main uses for a brush. I usually buy my brushes when they go on sale for half off so at my local art store, a brush usually costs me about 5$. So when I finally broke down and spent the money on one of these I was pretty excited to see how it would perform. In one word \"Terrible\"! It is by far the worst brush I have ever used and DOES NOT hold a point at all. I spent more time trying to just get this brush to hold a decent point for inking than actually inking. So frustrating to have heard so many people praising the Series 7 as the best brush around and then come to find out a size zero brush is only good for blocking in sections of black and is useless for detailed line work, that makes no sense at all. I recommend that someone looking for a brush to ink with stay away from the Series 7.",

So when I saw these, I thought \"Oh, these are a bit pricey, but hey! Maybe they are really impressive and I will treat myself. BIG NO!!!! These pens run dry VERY fast. As a matter of fact, they dried out afer about a square INCH of covered area. There are so many good reviews here, maybe the ones I bought have been on the shelf for a while (makes sense since they are twice the amount of fiskars and with fiskars you get 48 pens, this package was only 12 pens so they probably do not move as fast) So, truly, even if they ran great, and didn't run out, the colors are not so impressive that I would make the same mistake again.",

After having this happen to me with THREE different runners, I determined what caused the problem: it doesn't work when trying to go around curved shapes. Specifically, I was using the runner around a circle - every single time, the runner messed up. On one of the dispensers, I was able to straighten the tape, but it wouldn't wind properly (I had to use a screw driver to manually wind it - a big waste of my time.) With a new dispenser, I am able to do straight line gluing only; I don't use it for going around curved shapes - problem solved, huh?\n\nI will never buy this product again, no matter how sticky it may be!

        "I must be missing something. My friend gave me this glue to try.....she used it a lot for scrapbooking I presume. I'm not a scrapbooker, but do a lot of other crafts. This glue held absolutely nothing together for me.....NOTHING! I have tried it on several types of materials.....reindeer moss to objects, small polymer clay pieces, tiny tiny wood materials to eachother and even paper and so much more and I have to say I have never been so baffled as to how a product can be so popular and not even be able to hold 2 pieces of paper together.\n\nThe above experiment was a couple yrs ago. I was recently in walmart and saw turbo tacky glue and thought well maybe that will be better then my last experience.......mmmmm no.... same results.....I find these glues absolutely useless.",
        "It's so annoying when the manufacturer doesn't provide a list of compatible machines for those of us who are new at this and unfamiliar with the parts. The part looks well made. However, even though the description said it works with Singer models which have a side fastening thumb screw, which my machine has, this can't be installed on my Singer 5050C. Even on the Singer website, the manufacturer provides zero guidance on how it looks when installed or how it's supposed to work. This is the second time I've ordered something online where it wasn't made absolutely clear that this would not work with my machine, and that information would have been so easy to provide to the customer ahead of time. So frustrating.",
        "Ok let's start how the product is the quality is made well & looks good. But the manual leaves much to be desired, there is no trouble shooting for errors or problems that you would have to go to brothers website. Secondly the product needs to be updated because it runs on a Windows 7 or XP & if you have Windows 10 you need to update your driver & install. Thirdly the buttons on top of the file folder leaves much to your imagination because it doesn't give you much so good luck with that! Lastly after all of that figuring out don't be surprised if you get the design on the disc & go to your sewing machine and insert it just to say.........\"this embroidery card does not work with this machine?!#%*$@!!! Ok I'm done time to return it!!",
        "I was excited to have a \"knitter\" that would be more compact than the current popular \"round looms\" which I have been using.  The instructions that come with this are very vague.  I do not know how to \"knit\" but have had lots of fun with my round looms but I cannot figure this one out at all.  Product is probably great if you have previous knitting knowledge.",
        "No directions on how to use. A waste of money without the directions for use.",
        "I bought this etching medium to use on glasses for my wedding.  I have used a similar product before in a class and thought I would try this brand because it was cheaper and easier to find. The bottle has little to no instructions - just \"Shake well. Stencil, brush, sponge, or stipple.\" There were no directions on how long to leave on the stencil, the medium, whether or not the final product could be washed, how to care for it...the list goes on and on.  When I logged on to the company website, there was not much more in the way of instruction.  I ended up scrapping the project because I didn't have enough time before the big event to buy something else to try.  Very disappointing!",

The product is exactly as advertised and fine for the price but it is really useless in my opinion. You would have to use one hand to hold the tomato and the other to put in each individual pin. Its so light that it would slide around all over the place if you tried putting a pin in without holding it. I just bought the Dritz Magnetic Pin Caddy and its so much more amazing.

If you're looking for dazzle, these overhyped Copic pens won't deliver it. Normally, I use a combination of fine-nib markers: Copic Original, the excellent new Shinhan Touch Twin and Sakura Micron.

It's about as bad as selling a \"steem\" cleaner which doesn't produce steam to shampoo carpet and taking advantage of customers.\n\nThe seller was awesome..\n\nBut the Susan Bates Company ought to be reprimanded for misleading it's customers with the name of the knitting needle. I don't care if it said or not plastic anywhere-  i have a problem with the title bc it immediately misleads the person into not checking if the knitting needle is actually made of metal rather than plastic. Plastic has more friction resistance, which is probably nice for beginners, but not for fast knitters.\n\nThe length of the needle for english style knitting is perfect",

But only one (1) of the large, 12 of the medium, and then 38 of the small.  I'm sending it back and understand that Amazon will send a replacement. I'll see what comes. As I now look at the other reviews it looks like I can expect that to be similar.  I expect better from the Singer brand. Obviously their supplier is saving on cost, but this is really poor.

So when I saw these, I thought \"Oh, these are a bit pricey, but hey! Maybe they are really impressive and I will treat myself. BIG NO!!!! These pens run dry VERY fast. As a matter of fact, they dried out afer about a square INCH of covered area. There are so many good reviews here, maybe the ones I bought have been on the shelf for a while (makes sense since they are twice the amount of fiskars and with fiskars you get 48 pens, this package was only 12 pens so they probably do not move as fast) So, truly, even if they ran great, and didn't run out, the colors are not so impressive that I would make the same mistake again.",

I don't know why they have the word bulk in the listing.  Two weeks ago I ordered this directly from Amazon for $5.94.  Before I bought I contacted them to find out how many was in the \"bulk\".  They couldn't tell me.  So, I decided to find out, so i could post a review and let everyone else know.  I figured there would be at least two pens, considering that you can get it from many other websites for around $3.00.  This does not reflect on 123Stitch.  I've ordered from them before and love them.  The item came directly from Amazon drop-ship is no longer in the main items, it has moved to the other new for sale box in the right hand margin.  So, I wasn't able to leave a comment on the specific item listing that I ordered from.  At the time, the only listing for this pen on Amazon was for their drop-ship.  If 123stitch's listing had been available I would have gone with them, or to Ritz Camera's scrapbooking site.  I've gotten good service from Amazon many times before, but this instance has left me very disappointed.  So, now I have to pay to ship it back to them, then I will order from a site with a reasonable price.",

The product I received was hideous - she looked like a monster that had fake boobs. Scary and vulgar. This product might be just perfect for someone drawing superheroes and the like. But it should not be presented as natural-looking. I'm one of several who made this comment - why is the vendor not updating the product photo?\nAlso, paying $5 shipping plus $9 return shipping was super-annoying.\nPS. If it weren't for the false photo, I would give this 3-4 stars.

            "1 star mainly because the photo showed does not match the product. The natural-looking figure shown on Amazon is what I wanted. The product I received was hideous - she looked like a monster that had fake boobs. Scary and vulgar. This product might be just perfect for someone drawing superheroes and the like. But it should not be presented as natural-looking. I'm one of several who made this comment - why is the vendor not updating the product photo?\nAlso, paying $5 shipping plus $9 return shipping was super-annoying.\nPS. If it weren't for the false photo, I would give this 3-4 stars. Not because I would order it ever, but because the joints are moveable and it actually seems to be decent quality, in a quality package.",
            "A Waste of time -- took 9 days to et them -- and money. These were THIN, light weight , if fanned, they would flop. Thinner than the\ncardboard backing of my writing pad. Profoundly disappointed. They look and feel like CARDBOARD! I would have returned them but  as I waited so long to get them and my need is great, I'll use them. But will never again buy these or from this supplier."
