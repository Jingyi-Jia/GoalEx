    "Atomic Alchemy - Producing high-value isotopes for the world Atomic Alchemy is building a bank of reactors to produce the nuclear material that goes into nuclear medicine. Radiopharmaceuticals are vitally important in biological tracers, diagnostic imaging, and cancer treatments. Currently, the world's supply of Molybdenum-99, the cornerstone of 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures, is sourced from just six government-run, scientific research reactors abroad. Five of these reactors are 45-65 years old and are quickly coming to the end of their operational life. This has cultivated a fragile and lengthy supply chain, at odds with the nature of radioactive material. This issue and its implications do not just effect molybdenum, but any other reactor-based isotope. Many promising cancer therapies are stuck in clinical trials, unable to secure enough material in a timely manner. Research doesn\u2019t even happen because of the difficulty of sourcing any new isotopes. It doesn't have to be this way. Atomic Alchemy is working to solve this by building the world's first scalable radioisotope production facility. This facility will contain the world\u2019s first privately-owned nuclear reactors dedicated to radioisotope production.",

    "Assembly - We build trust, reduce waste, and reward better labor practices. Crowdfunding has fueled an increase in innovative product companies turning to Chinese factories for production. Yet, Chinese factories seem undifferentiated because they all make the same, unverifiable claims of excellence. This results in competition centered on price. Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays. This process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud. We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail). It encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business. On average, defect rate will fall 75% within 5 months of deploying Assembly at a factory.",
    "Lucy Goods, Inc - Lucy\u2019s mission is to reduce tobacco-related harm to zero. We provide\u2026 If it isn\u2019t bad enough that smokers don\u2019t realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience \u2014 with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way. Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn\u2019t carry around the sensation that they\u2019re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn\u2019t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven\u2019t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn\u2019t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco \u2014 first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products. So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine\u2019s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that",

        "Tajir - The one-stop shop for mom-and-pop stores in Pakistan to buy inventory. In Pakistan, stores struggle to buy inventory. Stores waste hours dealing with dozens of suppliers and wait passively for salesmen to visit their stores. Deliveries are often late, incorrect, or never arrive at all. Stores often learn prices at the point of delivery and cannot compare across different suppliers. Tajir solves this by offering a one-stop shop for all inventory purchasing with low prices, huge selection, and the convenience of 24/7 ordering with next-day delivery. Mom-and-pop stores are the arteries of Pakistan's economy. Through empowering them with world class logistics & information tools, Tajir aims to refactor and simplify Pakistan's retail economy.",

Unlike conventional aircraft configurations, our first seaglider will be capable of 180 miles at 180 mph with existing battery technology. Beginning in 2025, our seagliders will commence real world operations, build consumer trust, and generate revenue while our aircraft-building competitors are still embroiled in regulatory and technical challenges. In the future, when those challenges have been overcome, REGENT will transition seagliders to the air and grow upon years of commercial success. In the last 3 months we have closed $250M in LOIs from airlines and ferry companies.

        "Flightcontrol - Easily deploy scalable, secure applications without any devops Flightcontrol makes it easy for developers to deploy scalable, secure applications without any devops. We launched 10 weeks ago and have 18 paying customers live in production. We are growing quickly because Brandon created Blitz.js, an open-source Javascript framework with 11,000 Github Stars, and Flightcontrol is a solution to the problems Blitz users were experiencing. Brandon and Mina both have engineering degrees, and are building Flightcontrol to solve those same problems we personally experienced as consultants. We discovered AWS is built for low-level developers who want maximum performance and control, and Heroku was built as an easy solution for developers who didn\u2019t need that control. 15 years later, there\u2019s now a large segment of developers who do want maximum performance and control but without the difficulty of AWS. Flightcontrol solves this by providing a layer on top of AWS that makes it very easy to use and let\u2019s them pop the hood leverage the raw power of AWS. Because of this new approach, users have migrated their production apps to Flightcontrol from Heroku, Render, Vercel, and existing AWS setups they previously spent weeks building.

We launched 10 weeks ago and have 18 paying customers live in production. We are growing quickly because Brandon created Blitz.js, an open-source Javascript framework with 11,000 Github Stars, and Flightcontrol is a solution to the problems Blitz users were experiencing. Brandon and Mina both have engineering degrees, and are building Flightcontrol to solve those same problems we personally experienced as consultants. We discovered AWS is built for low-level developers who want maximum performance and control, and Heroku was built as an easy solution for developers who didn\u2019t need that control. 15 years later, there\u2019s now a large segment of developers who do want maximum performance and control but without the difficulty of AWS. Flightcontrol solves this by providing a layer on top of AWS that makes it very easy to use and let\u2019s them pop the hood leverage the raw power of AWS. Because of this new approach, users have migrated their production apps to Flightcontrol from Heroku, Render, Vercel, and existing AWS setups they previously spent weeks building.
