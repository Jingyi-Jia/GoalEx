Led by Jarret Glasscock and a group of expert human genome scientists,Cofactor has built a new category of diagnostic technology powered by unique and powerful RNA data models built on terabytes of data. The team recently had their technology validation peer-reviewed by the organizations that set standards for diagnostic technology (CAP, AMP) and is publishing in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics. In addition, the team made news when Cancer Physicians who sit on the committee for patient treatment guidelines (NCCN) presented a clinical study using Cofactor\u2019s technology showing superiority in predicting the patients who will respond to immunotherapy. This initial application is an acute problem recognized widely in the rapidly developing immunotherapy industry and represents north of a billion dollar TAM. After a number of recent key milestones, the team is taking the technology more broadly to 50% of cancers diagnosed in the US. Current investors include Menlo Ventures, DCVC, and Ascension Ventures (this last investor representing the funding arm for 13 National U.S. Healthcare Systems).",

Mass produced shirts were meant to accommodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size, and different brands have different sizing standards, making shopping difficult--many men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits! By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types. Tang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",

Scientists have been measuring gene activity in our cells for over twenty years now, but it\u2019s remained a mystery how diseases are able to turn certain genes on or off. Breast cancer, for example, is driven by 198 genes being activated when they shouldn\u2019t be, and we don\u2019t know why. But that\u2019s about to change. Just a few years ago, biologists discovered new molecules that turn genes on and off.

At Arpeggio, we\u2019ve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work. This gives scientists a clear understanding of how drugs and diseases function and has enabled our customers \u2013 including four of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world \u2013 to match the right treatments to the right patients, screen new compounds, and reposition existing drugs into new indications.",

We are building a full turn key\u2026 Vastrm Fashion\u2122 (pronounced vas' trum) Vastrm was started to solve a basic problem: Shirts that don\u2019t fit well!

By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types. Tang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again.

One of our core theses is that this idea couldn\u2019t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. Advantages to our P2P model - Entrepreneur-led - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of \u201ctop renters\u201d - More variety in inventory - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet - Better margins - we don\u2019t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don\u2019t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items.

Led by Jarret Glasscock and a group of expert human genome scientists,Cofactor has built a new category of diagnostic technology powered by unique and powerful RNA data models built on terabytes of data. The team recently had their technology validation peer-reviewed by the organizations that set standards for diagnostic technology (CAP, AMP) and is publishing in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics. In addition, the team made news when Cancer Physicians who sit on the committee for patient treatment guidelines (NCCN) presented a clinical study using Cofactor\u2019s technology showing superiority in predicting the patients who will respond to immunotherapy. This initial application is an acute problem recognized widely in the rapidly developing immunotherapy industry and represents north of a billion dollar TAM.

Scientists have been measuring gene activity in our cells for over twenty years now, but it\u2019s remained a mystery how diseases are able to turn certain genes on or off. Breast cancer, for example, is driven by 198 genes being activated when they shouldn\u2019t be, and we don\u2019t know why. But that\u2019s about to change. Just a few years ago, biologists discovered new molecules that turn genes on and off. Collectively, these molecules are known as the \u201cepigenome,\u201d and they\u2019re the control switches that determine how our cells work and give rise to disease. At Arpeggio, we\u2019ve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work. This gives scientists a clear understanding of how drugs and diseases function and has enabled our customers \u2013 including four of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world \u2013 to match the right treatments to the right patients, screen new compounds, and reposition existing drugs into new indications.",

We partner with local governments to save lives and taxpayer dollars. More than 20 million Americans struggle with addiction, but less than 10% of people who need it receive treatment. For those that do, it usually does not work - only 8% get better. Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people. We have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. Despite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs. Nick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin.
