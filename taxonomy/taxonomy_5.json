    "FYI, I recently ordered the GE MSWF filter by accident having read the nomenclature incorrectly.  The correct number for my refrigerator is GE GSWF.  Watch that \"M\" vs \"G\" in model number as they are different products for specific refrigerators!  Thank you, Al",
    "People should wait a while before posting reviews of this icemaker. Mine started pouring water all over the freezer after only three months of limited use.\n\nThe seller (partshouse) did warranty the icemaker, but I had to pay to ship the defective icemaker back and then pay to have a replacement ice maker shipped to me, so I was out close to $20 and I don't expect the new icemaker to last. Will pay extra and go OEM next time.",
    "If it would of had in the original description which cord it was it would of helped alot. Have to send back to get money back.",
    "I purchased this product on Feb. 11 2016. Today is 08/13/2017. It's dead. Has been for a while since all the food I had in it smells horrible. I opened it up to pull out some items to  make a gumbo which I had purchased on sell since a real gumbo is very expensive to make. I didn't have any idea it wasn't working because the lights were on.  This is all bad, today is Sunday and my disposal doesn't run until Thursday. I guess it's my fault for putting over 600.00 worth of food in a 200.00 freezer. Live and learn..",
    "Keeps falling down my drain.  Worthless!",
    "Doesn't clean your dishes. Awkward to load. Noisy. A lot of money for a piece of garbage. Doesn't deserve the one star.",
    "Purchased the first unit and it ran for a while, around 30 days, never getting the drinks cold.  Stopped all together and then went thru return steps with Haier.  They replaced the unit, satisfactory service on the replacement.\n\nThis new unit has not stopped yet, but just will not get anything cold.  Follow Haier's procedures for maximizing the cold temp, but still no go.\n\nDO NOT buy.",
    "not successfuly",
    "I plugged it in and used it for 3 days then turned it off and it sat for about a month, When i started it again only half the ice makers work an it does not shut off water supply to icemaker in a timely manner.",
    "Product does not have the slots for the elements from the stove, so thus a worthless product. Also product arrived chipped on several of the pans. Do not waste your money on these.",
    "After replacing the MSWF water filter (2 different filters), the water dispenser is now really slow. It also makes a squealing sound. I have no idea if this is a refurb part or not. I will try and purchase a filter from Home Depot or Lowe's and see if that works.",
    "We purchased this ice maker for use in our RV....  so basically it would be used 6 or 7 weekend trips per year.  The 3rd time we went to use it, it won't make ice.  I phoned Emerson who informed me that because I no longer had a receipt they would be going by the serial number which they said was too old for them to consider under warranty. I told them that it was still in the box and had only been used 2 other times.  They basically said \"Sorry...nothing that we can do\"  I then asked if I could send it in and PAY for a repair and they said NO.  I also asked the rep if she heard many stories like mine and she said all the time.\n\nIt was great the couple of times it actually worked, but now it's basically dead with no hope of fixing it.\n\nNeedless to say, with customer service like this, I will be steering clear of EMERSON in the future!!",
    "It is very difficult to get food through this splash guard.  I thought that they would have improved it but no such luck.",
    "This product causes foaming and the bubbles  stop the action.",
    "Lasted just long enough for the warranty to expire.  Nearly lost 150 dollars of meat and 5 months worth of breast milk.  Thankfully my sweet tooth led me to forage for ice cream after a long shift and I discovered this nasty surprise.  Otherwise it would have all been lost.  Spend the extra money to get a decent product, do not buy this piece of hot garbage.  You have been warned. Then again, so was I warned by other reviews and I bought it anyway.  Just know that you are buying an unreliable piece of junk and treat it accordingly.",
    "I'm disappointed in this product. I have acne and was using the Neutrogena peel to improve my skin tone and acne scars. I decided to give the Regenerist Mini-Peel a try to save money. The tube was a larger size for the same price.  I've tried the peel 3 different times and every time I had a pretty substantial break out the next day. I think the product is a little too abrasive for acne prone skin even with gentle rubbing.  I have used other Olay products and haven't experienced any problems. Maybe there should be a warning on the packaging that it shouldn't be used on skin prone to acne.",
    "This thing isn't even close to being correct.  None of the numbers are accurate.  I'm looking at this device next to an Ambient Weather device with a wired sensor.  The Acurite reads: outside- 71 degrees, 14% humidity.  It's actually 53 degrees outside and raining so I know the humidity is higher than 22%.  How in the world can there be a 18 degree variance?",
    "I bought a holmes humidifier last year, it requires this extremely over-priced filters every 1-2 months even you have very soft water. I was trying to find the replace filters in local stores this year and can not find it anywhere. Seems like to shop online is the only way to get the filters, the worst thing is the price this year is almost double compare to last year.\n\nI guess you probably will not find the filters next year, even you are lucky to find any, expect the price to be doubled again. Shame on Holmes, why can not they just stick with several lines of humidifiers using same size filters?",
    "did not fit our ge range! these things were too small and fell right through the stove holes! somebody in the questions section claimed that ge has one size drip pans for the last 50 years but that is obviously not the case and I have wasted money on this useless junk",
    "The hood motor/ fan assembly arrived quickly.  The problem is that the motor is set up to run Counterclockwise viewed from the motor's shaft end (per description) and the fan blade is a Clockwise rotation blade!  The apparent \"fix\"?  Stick the blade on the shaft upside down!  This is not conjecture on my part.  The fan plainly says on it \"6.625 CW 22 DEGREE\"\nWho in the supply chain is perpetrating this?  Is it knowing chicanery or abject stupidity?",
    "one was bent on the end neither one fits well.",

    "Couldn't use it -- didn't fit my Kenmore Humidifier -- instead of being used as a round one piece -- it was several rectangular\nflat pieces",
    "Long Term Review: Unit failed unexpectedly after less than 10 month of use.  Of course it was full of food, which makes the failure more expensive and messy to clean up.  Sad face/lesson learned I guess.",
    "My fiancee bought this unit as a Christmas gift for me.  Not only did my unit come with a damaged/dented corner and scratches all over the bottom. After getting it all hooked up with the co2 and a keg and turning it to it's max cool setting hoping for ice cold beer... I smell something burning and check the back components of the unit to find it's extremely hot to the point were certain materials were melting.  I have recently contacted the company (Nostalgia Electrics) in hopes they will make my experience with their products a better one, I am currently waiting on their reply. As it stands this unit was a waste of money. Not only was it $400, I paid $80 for a keg that got completely wasted. Oh and almost forgot, some parts are really cheaply made like the guardrail at the top, came with a snapped off peg, and the cheap black plastic tap handle... These were things I was willing to overlook, even the dents and scratches, but a potential fire hazard is where I draw the line...",
    "It's so many percents off from accurate hygrometers, it's ridiculous.\nIt's so inaccurate it's rendered useless and being returned.",
    "It is potentially dangerous to use with a drill.  I used it for the first time today, and the fiberglass lead wire was flying all over the place.  I can see this poking someone's eyeball out and causing blindness.  Secondly,the roray brush and a 3 foot section of the fiberglass lead came off way up my dryer duct and are stuck somewhere up there, which can cause lint to build up on it and potentially lead to a fire.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT.!!!!!  It may be OK to use without a drill attached as per the directions.",
    "I thought at first that this was a great product. Last week the edges around the flame caught fire and melted on my stove.\n\nthe seller was great though, got the item fast. Just a crappy product, not safe!!!!!",
    "This is the first time I have purchased these replacement filters through Amazon, but the price was attractive.  Unfortunately my humidifier is already signaling that the filters need to be replaced after only 6 weeks in the humidifier.  Previous filters have lasted at least one year.  This wasn't a very good buy after all.",
    "this fridge makes a ton of noise doesnt keep any thing cool. just bought it. now im reading all the bad reviews i should have never purchased this stupid item fraud company waste of money. should be reported to bbb. DO NOT BUY !WARNING!!!! IT DOESNT WORK I BOUGHT A NEW ONE !",
    "So disappointed.... I bought this as a gift for my father and it doesn't work!! My dad won't tell me so I can return it because he doesn't want me to feel bad.. But my mom told me!!! So annoying thay something as nice as this seems doesn't work!!",
    "Worked 3 months, drained & put up for winter. Now it won't stop leaking. Not worth the money for 3 months.",
    "This is my second Electrolux Dishwasher since the first one was replaced a couple of months after we purchased it. This dishwasher is horrible at washing dishes. I have to hand wash every item before it goes into the dishwasher. If any food is left on, it's baked on by the time the cycle is done. I've owned this dishwasher for three years and regret ever purchasing it. In fact I regret purchasing the Electrolux Washer, Dryer, Gas Range, Microwave and Refrigerator. I will never purchase another Electrolux appliance again! We paid top dollar for these crappy Electrolux appliances too and wish we could get our money back - what a rip off. I expected better quality from Electrolux. I am currently looking for a new dishwasher and will eventually replace all my appliances, but not with Electrolux.",
    "These filters are not correct lenght.  The OME filters are 11 inches long, these are only 8\".  Being too short allows air to bypass the filter, make the unit less efficient.  I was able to cut one of second set into three inch sections to fill the gap.  This allowed me to get the humidifier back in service, but destroyed the extra set of filters making the purchase less cost effective.  Several of the other reviews stated the same problem.  You, the supplier need to provide an 11\" long filter and indicate the size in you listing.  I would like either the right size filters or an extra set of these small one sent to me free of charge as I purchased these with YOUR indication that they were the correct replacement parts for my Kenmore 758.144150 humidifier.",
    "Cheaper at Walmart by a third of the price. BestAir wouldn't work with me either.",
    "Junk.  Product quality has deteriorated over the years. Extra care is needed handling the filters or they will split into sections making it very difficult to mount in humidifier.",
    "I will start by saying I owned one of these units for almost three years before the pump failed. My old Al-100 worked great, never had any issues. My one star rating comes from the issues I have had trying to get a replacement unit. I figured with the luck I had with my first unit, I would purchase the same unit again. The replacement unit was delivered, and as soon as it was plugged in there were issues. The machine had a horrible vibrating noise every time the fan was on, most likely a bad fan bearing. So I figured no issue, I will exchange and get another one. My new one arrived today, everything was going great, until the machine tried to dump the ice. The noise it makes is so loud it is comical. The water in my keurig machine (sitting next to it) actually vibrates during the dumping process. NewAir, you need to get your quality control issues solved quickly. I am so disappointed. I will update when my third, and final Al-100 arrives, hopefully it works better, but I am not betting on it.",
    "What a piece of junk! I don't know where Empire Savings get the filters from but this one didn't work from the start.  I replaced my used filter with this and there was hardly any water flow coming out after about 1 hour. After a week of using this, I gave up and went to Sears and bought a \"real' MWF filter for about $12 more ( $39 vs $52 ). Lo and behold, the water flows nicely....I have a strange feeling that the one I got from Empire Savings is \"refurbished\" and not new.",
    "This thing is a piece of junk. Stopped working the first day due to weak blades. I do not recommend it to anyone.",
    "Our 5 person office bought this ice maker for our lunch room. Loved it for 3 months and then it crapped out.  We had bought the 3 year warranty and called Danby, they said to call their local appliance dealer who prompty came and said he needed a part from Danby. Almost a year has gone by and no part (or ice).  I think these small units just don't have enough life in them to justify the price.  Better to get a small fridge with a freezer/auto icemaker if you've got the room, unfortunately we don't.",
    "Takes forever to make ice and when its does the ice is a slushy mess. I so wanted this to be part of my man cave bar but sadly it has disappointed me. Can't win them all. But this is certainly a loser for me.",
    "I bought this filter as a spare a few months ago, just replaced it, no water goes through.....When I put the old one back in, it is fine.  Too bad I cannot return it.",
    "No only did I find it cheaper at a retail store, but the whole concept behind it is very flawed.",
    "when left side by side for 2 days, the temperature was off by 7 degrees and the humidity reported 40% on 1 and 32% on the other.  I returned the item.",
    "The manual on/off switch on the unit is made of cheap quality. I pressed it and the button went inside the unit. Now it's useless. Used one time and threw it away. Junk\n\nHad a power outage & was gone for the weekend. The garbage disposal powered on after the power outage leaving it running for 3 days. My neighbors were pissed. I would not buy this as I am surprised my disposal didn't burn up or catch the house on fire. There needs to be I auto shut off after say a few minutes.",
    "The ice maker shut off lever gets stuck in the off position on every batch of ice.  Today it's stuck in the off position and won't turn on.",
    "Lame",
    "I picked this item up at Target and was pleased how it worked for 24 hours. Unfortunately like others, the add water light came on and would never go off. I followed the manual instructions and repeatedly tried to reset the machine. But it was dead. I returned it to Target for a full refund and their customer service was outstanding. No hassles. I have always steered clear of anything with the Emerson name on it because of poor workmanship, but time and distance had made me forgetful. I will not make the same mistake again.",
    "Only lasted 1 year!  Too expensive for making ice if it only has 1 yr of life !  It stopped making ice",
    "pos",
    "Inferior product alert!!! It just arrived, I am not even going to unwrap the plastic off it, I will just return it.\nIt is physically thinner than my current filter, has thin black mesh inside it, no thicker blue layer, so I do not see how it's going to filer very much like that. See photos of it held up to a light, this product is the one still in the plastic. the 2nd and 3rd photos are of my original (black and blue and barely lets any light through). I don't know how it could be so highly rated for such an inferior product or how a company called \"Industrial Filter Sales\" could be selling something that won't filter much at all.",
    "This ice maker has a very bad appearance and works like a junk. 1",
    "They turned moldy and nasty within a month of use in a completely cleaned out humidifier that received the bacteriostatic treatment with each fill.  I had to pitch the humidifier.",
    "Terrible time getting this product.  Product appears to just be water.  It says it is supposed to do something, but there is no smell or change when used in large humidifier.",
    "Description was not useful",
    "I have bought 4 of these from Amazon. I have calibrated all four for temperature accuracy and they all consistently read the same within acceptable limits.  However, with one of the units I cannot adjust the relative humidity.  I cannot correct the humidity reading with the adjustment. The dew point reading depends upon the accuracy of the relative humidity and so the dew point is in error.  I need a good dew point reading to prevent mold in some air handling equipment so this unit forces me to guess on its error and estimate the dew point.  Not a good feeling.  Some people might think three out of four is not bad but I don't see why I have to put up with the time and trouble caused by poorly manufactured and tested products!  One star, less if I could!",
    "Product fell apart in 3 weeks. Poor quality. Do not buy.",
    "Cheaply made. The \"off\" stop brokeon installation. Won't buy from here again.",
    "I now realize the one I got was not the original but the un-printed box fake product and got scammed nearly 50$ for it",
    "Only three covers arrived and they were thin and cheap.  I didn't have the energy to put them back in the mail and ask for a refund so I threw them away.",
    "I have had trouble with a basement dryer vent.  After catching on fire, I decided to buy this indoor dryer vent kit.  Yes, it's inexpensive, and technically does what it's supposed to do...  It's flimsy, allows moisture to saturate the wall and floor, but worst of all it allows lint to accumulate all over the room.  I put a mesh bag around it to try to stop the lint from flying out, but it still escapes.  Messy, flimsy and heading for a moldy disaster soon.  Save your few dollars and invest in something with more filtering capabilities (if it's out there).  I am looking.",
    "I give this zero stars. Ours quit, then I look on Amazon and find the same thing happened to many others. We lost hundreds of dollars of meat.",

Everything you need comes with the Waste King L-1001. I ripped out the old 3 bolt mounting system and installed the new EZ Mount that came with the L-1001. It's installed, it lined up exactly as the old In-Sink-Erator 3 (Badger 1 Model) disposal, and works fine without having to buy anything extra.",
    "Were not universal, did not fit my stove at all.",
    "The fan is nice but I couldn't see that it had to be hook up from exhaustion from the ceiling connect to outside. I end up not using it and wasting my money. Not happy and it need more pictures to show the whole unit of it. All sides. U have to make wires and cords to connect  this exhaust. I guess it good if you a electrician and can do the wires, if not you out of luck.",
    "When I installed this filter my water dispenser began began acting erratically.",
    "We replaced our existing MWF filter with this one. After we installed it, and began to run the water through the system, the refrigerator began making a horrible groaning noise that we have never heard before and the water capacity coming out of the dispenser reduced greatly. We tried pulling the filter out and reinstalling, to no improvement. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with a filter. Unfortunately, I don't see a link anywhere that allows me to contact the seller for a replacement filter.",
    "I'd leave 0 stars if I could. Improperly sized. The small pans fit but the large ones do not.",
    "Don't buy this filter. We use humidifier only at night time in the bedroom. It worked only the first night. Next day it doesn't get wet above the water level - and humidity level never increases. I flip it the other day and it worked for one night. But the next night it's all over again - no humidity, stays dry all night. Waste of money.",
    "Melted after a few days.",
    "I bought these twice now - I thought that spending a little more for these would solve the problem I had last time but it didn't. They catch fire and burn and then they turn a grayish white and disintegrate. They look terrible. The reason I bought these was to cover up the stove that couldn't be cleaned after scrubbing numerous times....you have to cut a big area out around the burners so they don't catch fire - I thought I didn't cut a big enough circle the first time and they all burned, so I paid more for these (can get them for half price elsewhere) and cut huge circles around the burners and they STILL singed on spots and look ridiculous. I will never buy these again.",
    "This is a flimsy piece of junk. Do not waste money on it.",
    "I bought a refurbished one of this model from Woot.com through Amazon,got the thing yesterday and with much anticipation carefully followed the directions and set it up. Set up is easy,these are not complicated machines. However I was sent one that evidently was NOT refurbished. The cooling elements did not get cold enough to make ice. It was very upsetting as We were going to use it for a party. Sending it back to Woot.",
    "This is NOT a GE filter.  Its a cheap, horrible knock-off. The water flow sucks and stops altogether multiple times per day.",
    "These things eventually get lost or damaged or they just wear out.  It's a good idea to have a spare on hand (if you can remember where you put it).  This particular one is made of material that is too thick or just too rigid.  The opening is not flexible enough for the waste to go down into the disposer without being pushed.  I am going to try to file or sand it down so see if I can weaken it enough to make it work; if not, I'll just have to contact Waste King to get a replacement.  Very annoying..",
    "Have had this dishwasher for 3.5 years and this is my first problem with it.  However, it is the same 03 error code (wash pump not working) that many of the prior reviewers have experienced on this website and as noted on other sites, and upon calling Electrolux for warranty (or defective part) coverage, of course, there is nothing covering this type of issue.  It is incredibly frustrating that with my very low usage (travel much of the time and typically do one to two loads a week, if that) that essentially after a typical 1.5 years of usage, the wash pump has to be replaced.  Obviously, they don't stand behind the equality of the product.  Although customer service was relatively helpful in pricing out the potential part replacement costs and recognized local appliance repair people, when asking me at the end of the call, if I wanted to participate in customer service survey, and I said, \"You Betcha\" ready to blast Electrolux, I was amazingly transferred into oblivion, which has NEVER happened in a survery situation before.  I think it was a matter of selective disconnection for survey manipulation...I think Kelly Ripa needs to attach her name to another brand!!  Would not buy another product from this company, which is so disappointing as I like so many aspects of this dishwasher.",
    "With a quick temperature rise, such as from cloudy to sunny, this adds much more:  Today, the outside temperature is about 49 F, this reads 77 F.  The other devices read from 49 to 55, the 55 item is a thermocouple that close to brick that was is the sun.  Used a infrared sensor on the outside sensor for this device.  It reads 49 F.  O:ne, or both units, the exterior sensor or the readout is defective.  The batteries are new alkaline, tested excellent with a battery tester.  Other consumers have the same problem.  I will ask for refund; this was a Christmas present, and we have had the usual cloudy mostly, here in eastern Missouri.  Reads 76 F, actual with 3 other methods, 49 F",

    "They cannot figure out how to control the mildew that traps in the gasket area. Do not get sucked in by the cute size - there is NO WAY to win this mildew battle.

    "we have this unit for only 3 months and now it stop functioning!! Really bad",
    "Three Evaporators replaced in 2.5 years. Total Junk. Four months prior to the manufacturer warranty expired and it failed. Evaporator replaced. Six months later under a service contract, it failed again. One week after receiving it back, failed again. I'm convinced that the service companies are milking the service contract for low hanging fruit on this product, but aren't actually finding the real leak. Danby all but said, sorry about your luck and were no help. I don't recommend this product or any purchase of a Danby product as a result. This thing has been a total lemon. It's currently unplugged and awaiting yet another repair under the service contract. I plan to replace it with another name brand product.",
    "If any other clamp is available, try it before buying this under-engineered piece of junk.  The clamp is made JUST big enough to fit around the vent tube, IF that tube were perfectly smooth which, of course, it's not.  You need to unscrew the clamp until the screw is on its very last thread to make it fit...and even then, it's a major accomplishment to get it on.  Whirlpool must have saved a penny in materials on every 10,000 of these things by making them 1/8\" too short.  A little job that should have taken less than five minutes turned into a half hour of cursing.  Having said that, Whirlpool's vent tube is pretty nice, as it's thicker than most.  It didn't crumple like cheaper ones do when you apply pressure on its walls when stretching it out, or while bending it into place.  So, buy the tube; forget the thin, short hunk of scrap metal they call a clamp.",
    "I ordered an MSWF filter and received a GSWF filter. The box had a small part sticker on the bottom that stated the items was MSWF but the GE markings clearly stated it was a GSWF.  The Amazon rep took care of me as expected but its just not worth the hassle.  Don't buy from Dealicious!!",
    "I pick this item up to work with a fan and filter that I bought from Amazon but when I took this ducting tubing out of it's plastic bag it had a very strong order to it that did not go away. Within a shot time I just had to put it back into it's bag and get it out of my house because of the strong chemical order it had. It was a great price but maybe the awful order to it prompted them to sell it at such a low price. Didn't work out for me.",

    "Didn't fit my stove...",
    "I have always been satisfied with these in the past,  this one appears to be a lemon.  I didn't install this right away so the return period has expired.  I received this on Feb 3rd!  This filter doesn't help the water a bit, the old one I replaced gave me great water, wish I had hung on to it.  Thought after a day it would improve but no luck.",
    "This product looks beautiful on the outside, but the quality is very poor. I definitely  do not recommend the product.",

I hope these are okay .\nAppliancepartspros.com has a great how to video .

    "if you are even considering this fridge please take this one piece of advice, BUY EXTENDED WARRANTY!!! I didn't want to, luckily my wife talked me into it bc it saved our butts! Spent $2000 on this, it has had to be services 8 times in a year and half, and now the extended warranty people finally said it is dead after it has. continued to leak water from the fridge and freezer for 3 weeks(3 service calls to try and fix in the 3 weeks) I now have damage to my kitchen floor, tiles coming up and warped from the damage. Woke up one morning with a huge puddle of water, downhill from there. The parts for this fridge over so expensive! One bottom rail in the freeze is $400, PLUS service call price. It is the only french door fridge with the evaporator on the back, which causes additional issues while servicing it bc it takes 2 service techs together to try and fix it. Love the features but they don't mean a whole lot when is ruining you home and my family of 7 has gone without a freezer for 3 weeks. If you do buy it, PLEASE buy the extended warranty, you are going to need it!",

For the money, you will be better off getting a BETTER VENT, which uses NO WATER.  Look it up here on Amazon and you'll see what I mean.  I like the BETTER VENT and for all practical purposes I would call it the BEST VENT!  The BETTER VENT is very easy to install, and you don't have to remove the whole box to empty the lint!  Once a week I vacuum the inside area of the BETTER VENT, as well as the FILTER.  The filter is replaceable, but not 'washable' or 'rinseable' but vacuuming it works well for me.  I've had my BETTER VENT for almost two months and am VERY PLEASED with it.  I bought six extra filters, but haven't changed the original filter yet.  On top of the unit there is a small door which swings up to indicate that the filter needs attention.  If you vacuum it once a week, like me, you'll have no problem.  I don't think there's anyone near us, who washes and dries as much clothes as we do!  I was a skeptic at first, and thought that the BETTER VENT was a bit 'pricey' but I can tell you that it's well worth the investment!",

He also said when I buy another dishwasher look for one that has more than a 1 year warranty without having to buy an extended warranty so basically he said not to buy a whirlpool because they only offer a 1 year warranty as a standard warranty.

Oh, its not fine! i even showed the tech the clothes...he shaked his head and he said his hands are tied.\nit was not fine the first week i bought it, and ABC Warehouse or the company does not care. I am stuck until i can afford another, and then i will feel too guilty about selling it to somebody else-but then what,-sell a $700 washer for scrap metal?\nOH yea....the extra huge large capacity is a farce..you try filling this bomb up and all it does is wrinkle your clothes and shoots water on it here and there, and leaves soap residue all over. They should have recalled this lemon.",

With that much water the tennis shoes never get the agitation necessary.  If I put a pair of dirty jeans in the washer that I want an extra about of water to wash and rinse, there is no way to control this.  This is a very bad technology that whirlpool came up with.

Three LG technicians came and saw the problems, finally they replace it with a new one. We had the same problems from the day one. Their technicians came and saw our problem again, they recommended that we should install water softener, use the vinegar,  jetdry and everything that you could thick of and we did all of it. Still the problems did not go away. Their technician came for the last time and they referred us to LG customer service to buy back the unit. But the customer service denied our case. I have to wash my dishes by hand. This product is awful. Don't buy LG at all and don't waste your money.",

I turned the dial as warm as it would go to no avail.  I started adjusting the little adjustment screw to see if it had been set wrong at the factory, but that didn't help either.  The thermostat either let things get too hot and wouldn't turn the fridge on or would continue to freeze everything.\nI sent them an email through Amazon explaining my problem, but have received no response after five days.  I sent the unit back to them and hope to get a full refund.",
    "We have a humidifier in our bedroom and run it in the winter to keep the humidity level around 50%, I can tell when the filter/wic is starting to go bad by how often the humidifier runs. With a new filter it'll run for a couple minutes and shut of for a while, continuing this cycle. When they start to go bad, the humidifier runs constantly. Well this filter worked all of about 2 weeks. Not only is my humidifier running constantly now with this one bad already, this one STINKS when it goes bad.\nSpend the extra couple dollars and get the version with 'aluminum reinforcement', not this black one. The other version lasted at least 2 months for me.",

We nick named it our little 'Cylon' as it became more than an appliance, it became our house-hold, stainless steel nemesis.

Amusing to watch our kitten's reaction to the demonic Cylon, but there are more inexpensive forms of entertainment.  Fortunately, mine was covered by a warranty, but after $800 of repairs, the repairmen (several tried) and insurer gave up and our 'Toaster' is now probably enjoying its second life as an automobile bumper.",

Re-read the directions, emptied the unit and refilled the unit and plugged it back in and waited. And waited. And waited. Still no ice.  Did not even make a sound.  I have requested an exchange for this one because I still really want it. I read all the other reviews before I ordered and it seemed like it was hit or miss if you actually got one that worked.

I used it all this past winter, and I got mixed results with its ability to prolong the pad's life. Then I began to notice chest pains off and on, but only brief twinges of pain. Nothing lasting. After weeks of it I began to get a little concerned that it was something more serious than just lung irritation. I started to think the worst, but I wasn't completely convinced it wasn't allergies.\n\nI decided to experiment, so I discontinued using this water treatment and ...the pains immediately went away. This is not a scientific investigation, just a case of cause and effect. After researching the problem, I discovered that I am not alone. Others have reported chest pains with this product. My opinion is that if it is causing chest pain, it is something to be avoided at all costs.",

I could get one end to slide on snuggly, but then when I would stretch out the hose to attach the other end the first end would slide off.  I was only trying to stretch the hose about 2 feet to make the connection but the hose is very rigid and pulled the first end off.  The plastic ends also have a thin rubber-like gasket in them that slid up into the hose as I slid them onto the dryer or wall attachments.  I got frustrated and ended up tearing the plastic adapters off and attaching the hose directly to the dryer and wall with the help of tape.

Poor design but vendor should provide an alternative that can be reused - albeit more expensive.",

Ours is a KitchenAid and, while the water supply valve is 1/4\" and this will fit on that end, the end in the refrigerator is completely different and this won't fit. The description on Amazon makes it sound like this is a universal hose and it is not. Be sure to check both ends of the hose you're replacing before ordering.",

I tried defrosting the thing but it pushed out one more set of ice then died again.  So to summarize, the first one died after twelve months, and the second one died after a month.

Basically the fake stainless separates from the underlying plastic knob and bubbles up/peels off over time.\n\nThey won't cover it under warranty. They told me that I could purchase the replacements ($16 each, same knobs as the ones that are already having the issue).

So then I tried with my original copper tubing, cutting it to try the install. No dice, same leaks at connection points.\n\nAttempting to install this product ended up costing me $26.\n\nI replaced the copper tubing with a stainless steel connection like this, for a much more secure connection:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Watts-WTS-SPCC120-44PB-Stainless-Icemaker-10-Foot/dp/B00439HNF4/ref=pd_cp_hi_0\n\nUPDATE 5/31/12: I found an ice maker filter that I am very happy with: [...]  Installs easily with 1/4\" threaded connections - no danger of leaks!",

As time went on it got louder and louder. Looks like the fan was never really balanced. It is incredibly loud now! Of course, it only got really bad after the return window had expired!. To make matters worse, the clip tabs for the grill in front are incredibly puny and snapped the first time I removed it, I can't believe I spent $100 on this and feel that I should be able to return it. No one else had this problem so I probably just got a bad one.",
    "We've owned this dishwasher for one year. Four repair calls so far . . . one of those repairs was an installation error, so that's forgivable. But the other three were for leaks that caused the instrument panel to flash, with all lights blinking. The \"all lights blinking\" error is so common for this Electrolux dishwasher (just check the Internet) that, ta-da, it's part of the lore of the model. If you buy one, beware--you will likely undergo the same issue. Luckily we bought the extended four-year warranty or we'd be up a leaky dishwasher creek without a paddle. So every few months, it happens again, we call the repair service, they come and fix it, it works a few more months, ad nauseum. Whatever is up with this model, Electrolux needs to do better or they will face a class-action lawsuit. We paid $1000 for this defective dishwasher. Sadly, when the machine is working, I love it--it cleans effectively, it's whisper quiet, it's an EnergySaver, and it has a ton of features. C'mon, Electrolux--all that engineering you put into designing the thing and you neglect to make it leak-resistant? For shame.",

    "I own a Bosch and I would say there is a 90% chance that you will regret your decision to buy Bosch within 3 years. Bosch is at the top of Consumer Reports - they have no shame. My Bosch dishwasher is very, very quiet because it hardly ever works. In the past 3 years, I have had to replace the Electronic Control Unit at about $130 a pop. Yesterday it pooped out again. I'm going to buy a new dishwasher rather than fix the bosch again. Bosch is completely unreliable. It is the most unreliable thing I own! I will NEVER buy a Bosch again.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Bosch is the Control Unit. Other problems include heater malfunction and the water inlet valve malfunctions. I have NEVER been so disappointed with any purchase as I am with the Bosch. For those of you who purchased a Bosch, and those of you who plan to purchase a bosch, you will want to keep [...] in your favorites.\n\nGood Luck!",

At first I assumed it wouldn't make that much of a difference, but after two weeks this filter is already growing mold. This seems like a significant health risk. I used the filter that came with my himidifier all Winter last year with no mold (had a blue pre-filter). I tossed it at the end of the season as the humidifier suggested. I never would have done so had I known that it would be impossible to replace that filter with an identical filter. They do not seem to be available at all anymore, even directly from the manufacturer. I never would have purchased that humidifier if I had known I would never be able to find quality replacement filters.\n\nThis did appear to be a genuine Honeywell replacement filter. It's just not the same as the one that came with my original humidifier. Not worth the money. Waste of time, effort, and money. I cannot afford to spend 15 bucks on a new filter every two weeks. I do NOT recommend this product.",

My order and my receipt both say IC-100 (no A) and since there doesn't seem to be a way to directly talk to Amazon or e-mail them, I'm just returning these.

And even worse than this, our sink started stinking a few months after switching to this disposer.  I guess it's the rotting food in the base.  I've tried running whole containers of ice through it as well as baking soda.

I found the online help to get the door open.  For those of you needing to manually get the door open, remove the bottom panel (3 7mm nut-head screws) and reach up on the right side of the door.  There is a grey release tab if pulled downward will open the door.\n\nBack to the washer problems. A local repair service from the company we purchased the machine from refused to work on it, saying that we will have to have the whirlpool service company come do it.  He says these error codes refer to faulty circuit boards and the repair bill is usually at least $600 and people get very angry with him when they find this out and he just won't do it anymore.\n\nI am disappointed to see so many people reporting this problem and getting no response from Whirlpool. This purchase is alot of money for average people and I am appalled at having to repace a $900 washer in less than 2 years after buying it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Whirlpool Duet washers or dryers to anyone.

    "The new and improved filters IMHO is more about cost savings than a better filter.  The new improved all white filters without the outer blue lining protec are junk.\n\nThe outer blue lining not only added the Antimicrobial Treatment but it strengthened the filter.  The outside weave on the new filter is larger and does not hold together as well.  On the previous model the Protec lining was much tighter/smaller helping to trap more dust and strengthen the integrity of the filter.  I had no issues with moisture flow from the blue lined filters.  None of the tips i.e. flipping when refilling tanks, completely rewetting every few days, etc do anything to prolong the life of the new filters.\n\nI am on my second season.  Last season replaced the blue filters twice.  This season I was barely getting 2 weeks with the all new greatly improved, aka junk, filters.\n\nI emailed numerous online vendors in hopes they had inventory of the blue lined filters.  No dice.  But luckily I found salvation on Ebay.  I have now greedily stockpiled over 10 of the previous blue filters and at a lower cost to new improved filters.  This should last me a few years.  I hope by then the bean counters at Honeywell realize their mistake and revert to the previous model.  One can hope.  Until then avoid the new improved filters.  They are useless.

I use the humidifier all the time so the filter has to be wet all the time. I was told that since I purchased the filter from Amazon to return it to them. Which didn't seem right to me since it is their product that is faulty. I contacted Amazon who sent me another filter and it too is on the verge of falling apart. I chose this filter because of the Honeywell name, but they do not stand behind this product which is disappointing. I have since bought another brand, Best Air HW14, (https://www.amazon.com/BestAir-HW14-Honeywell-Replacement-Humidifier/dp/B004EZT38M) and it is far superior to this item.

    "July 10, 2015 update:  I see that these covers are now being sold for over $13; in 2007 I paid much less for them and thought they were overpriced.  As burner covers, the only way they will sit properly, depth wise, is if the burner head is flush with the rest of the cooking surface, or, with my new stovetop, there is a raised iron panel over the burner where the cover can sit levelly.  Do not try to guess and hope that these covers will fit a raised burner.  The other concern is that the spacing of the burners may preclude using them.\n\nDo not pay attention to the 9 x 9 x 2 inch product description if you are wanting a deep cover.  I tried unsuccessfully with Amazon and the vendor to verify ahead of time the depth of these covers.  Amazon didn't know and referred me to the Corelle vendor, which also did not know.  I took a chance because most of the time Amazon's dimensions are accurate.  While they are 9 inches square, not only are they not 2 inches deep; they are only 7/8 inch deep.  These covers should not even be classified as gas burner covers because at that depth they are more suitable for electric ranges.  They are also more cheap looking in person than what the picture displays.  For $5.63 they are not worth my time to return.  Thinking outside the box, I'm going to use them under plants on my patio.",

Another problem is that once you put it together, it can't be dismantled (pieces of metal have to be bent as you snap it together), making returns extremely difficult. You'll have to return the whole thing assembled, versus in two parts, and the box isn't big enough for that.\n\nThe instructions read: \"Note: Once the product is assembled, it cannot be taken apart or returned.\"",

The fan is positioned in the worst possible place - in the middle at the very back of the unit - the only steam, smoke, etc. it could catch would have to come from the control panel of the stove - where there are no burners. As it is now, steam from boiling pots just go over the front edge of the hood and up to the cabinet doors, where it condenses and runs down them, over the hood and back onto the stove; or it gathers under the hood, condenses and runs down the wall behind the stove. Now I regret replacing the other unit. Don't bother with this model unless you have some bizarre stove that has one burner, right in the middle of the very back of the cooktop.",

I smell something burning and check the back components of the unit to find it's extremely hot to the point were certain materials were melting.  I have recently contacted the company (Nostalgia Electrics) in hopes they will make my experience with their products a better one, I am currently waiting on their reply. As it stands this unit was a waste of money. Not only was it $400, I paid $80 for a keg that got completely wasted. Oh and almost forgot, some parts are really cheaply made like the guardrail at the top, came with a snapped off peg, and the cheap black plastic tap handle... These were things I was willing to overlook, even the dents and scratches, but a potential fire hazard is where I draw the line...",

I asked the distributor if I could send the filter back since I had not opened it at all. The reply was CERTAINLY for a small restocking fee of $10.

This allowed me to get the humidifier back in service, but destroyed the extra set of filters making the purchase less cost effective.  Several of the other reviews stated the same problem.  You, the supplier need to provide an 11\" long filter and indicate the size in you listing.

The clamp is made JUST big enough to fit around the vent tube, IF that tube were perfectly smooth which, of course, it's not.  You need to unscrew the clamp until the screw is on its very last thread to make it fit...and even then, it's a major accomplishment to get it on.  Whirlpool must have saved a penny in materials on every 10,000 of these things by making them 1/8\" too short.  A little job that should have taken less than five minutes turned into a half hour of cursing.  Having said that, Whirlpool's vent tube is pretty nice, as it's thicker than most.  It didn't crumple like cheaper ones do when you apply pressure on its walls when stretching it out, or while bending it into place.  So, buy the tube; forget the thin, short hunk of scrap metal they call a clamp.",

I guess it's my fault for putting over 600.00 worth of food in a 200.00 freezer. Live and learn..",
        "We purchased this ice maker for use in our RV....  so basically it would be used 6 or 7 weekend trips per year.  The 3rd time we went to use it, it won't make ice.  I phoned Emerson who informed me that because I no longer had a receipt they would be going by the serial number which they said was too old for them to consider under warranty. I told them that it was still in the box and had only been used 2 other times.  They basically said \"Sorry...nothing that we can do\"  I then asked if I could send it in and PAY for a repair and they said NO.  I also asked the rep if she heard many stories like mine and she said all the time.\n\nIt was great the couple of times it actually worked, but now it's basically dead with no hope of fixing it.\n\nNeedless to say, with customer service like this, I will be steering clear of EMERSON in the future!!",
        "Lasted just long enough for the warranty to expire.  Nearly lost 150 dollars of meat and 5 months worth of breast milk.  Thankfully my sweet tooth led me to forage for ice cream after a long shift and I discovered this nasty surprise.  Otherwise it would have all been lost.  Spend the extra money to get a decent product, do not buy this piece of hot garbage.  You have been warned. Then again, so was I warned by other reviews and I bought it anyway.  Just know that you are buying an unreliable piece of junk and treat it accordingly.",
        "I bought a holmes humidifier last year, it requires this extremely over-priced filters every 1-2 months even you have very soft water. I was trying to find the replace filters in local stores this year and can not find it anywhere. Seems like to shop online is the only way to get the filters, the worst thing is the price this year is almost double compare to last year.\n\nI guess you probably will not find the filters next year, even you are lucky to find any, expect the price to be doubled again. Shame on Holmes, why can not they just stick with several lines of humidifiers using same size filters?",

After getting it all hooked up with the co2 and a keg and turning it to it's max cool setting hoping for ice cold beer... I smell something burning and check the back components of the unit to find it's extremely hot to the point were certain materials were melting.  I have recently contacted the company (Nostalgia Electrics) in hopes they will make my experience with their products a better one, I am currently waiting on their reply. As it stands this unit was a waste of money. Not only was it $400, I paid $80 for a keg that got completely wasted. Oh and almost forgot, some parts are really cheaply made like the guardrail at the top, came with a snapped off peg, and the cheap black plastic tap handle... These were things I was willing to overlook, even the dents and scratches, but a potential fire hazard is where I draw the line...",

I have to hand wash every item before it goes into the dishwasher. If any food is left on, it's baked on by the time the cycle is done. I've owned this dishwasher for three years and regret ever purchasing it. In fact I regret purchasing the Electrolux Washer, Dryer, Gas Range, Microwave and Refrigerator. I will never purchase another Electrolux appliance again! We paid top dollar for these crappy Electrolux appliances too and wish we could get our money back - what a rip off. I expected better quality from Electrolux. I am currently looking for a new dishwasher and will eventually replace all my appliances, but not with Electrolux.",

I replaced my used filter with this and there was hardly any water flow coming out after about 1 hour. After a week of using this, I gave up and went to Sears and bought a \"real' MWF filter for about $12 more ( $39 vs $52 ). Lo and behold, the water flows nicely....I have a strange feeling that the one I got from Empire Savings is \"refurbished\" and not new.",

We had bought the 3 year warranty and called Danby, they said to call their local appliance dealer who prompty came and said he needed a part from Danby. Almost a year has gone by and no part (or ice).  I think these small units just don't have enough life in them to justify the price.  Better to get a small fridge with a freezer/auto icemaker if you've got the room, unfortunately we don't.",

It's flimsy, allows moisture to saturate the wall and floor, but worst of all it allows lint to accumulate all over the room.  I put a mesh bag around it to try to stop the lint from flying out, but it still escapes.  Messy, flimsy and heading for a moldy disaster soon.

Unfortunately, I don't see a link anywhere that allows me to contact the seller for a replacement filter.",

They catch fire and burn and then they turn a grayish white and disintegrate. They look terrible. The reason I bought these was to cover up the stove that couldn't be cleaned after scrubbing numerous times....you have to cut a big area out around the burners so they don't catch fire - I thought I didn't cut a big enough circle the first time and they all burned, so I paid more for these (can get them for half price elsewhere) and cut huge circles around the burners and they STILL singed on spots and look ridiculous.

Woke up one morning with a huge puddle of water, downhill from there. The parts for this fridge over so expensive! One bottom rail in the freeze is $400, PLUS service call price. It is the only french door fridge with the evaporator on the back, which causes additional issues while servicing it bc it takes 2 service techs together to try and fix it.

He also said when I buy another dishwasher look for one that has more than a 1 year warranty without having to buy an extended warranty so basically he said not to buy a whirlpool because they only offer a 1 year warranty as a standard warranty.

I am stuck until i can afford another, and then i will feel too guilty about selling it to somebody else-but then what,-sell a $700 washer for scrap metal?\nOH yea....the extra huge large capacity is a farce..you try filling this bomb up and all it does is wrinkle your clothes and shoots water on it here and there, and leaves soap residue all over. They should have recalled this lemon.",

Three LG technicians came and saw the problems, finally they replace it with a new one. We had the same problems from the day one. Their technicians came and saw our problem again, they recommended that we should install water softener, use the vinegar,  jetdry and everything that you could thick of and we did all of it. Still the problems did not go away. Their technician came for the last time and they referred us to LG customer service to buy back the unit. But the customer service denied our case. I have to wash my dishes by hand. This product is awful. Don't buy LG at all and don't waste your money.",

Got the new chest freezer, but well after the return period expired. Opened it, and it didn't work at all.  No LCD readout, no green or red LEDs, nothing. Tried better AAA battery.  Unit is completely dead.  And no return possible.  This sucks.  Not expensive units, but I shouldn't have to buy a another new one.  Amazon:  if you're reading these and you care:  treat me right.",
        "This little filter costs 40 bucks. Also, it just flooded my house because it's completely exposed in the fridge and works its way loose easily, at which point it fills the fridge up with water. Then, when you open the fridge door, instead of deciding whether to drink milk or juice, 50 gallons of water cascades onto your hardwood floors, then leaks into your heating system and eventually drains out over your AV system. Also, it filters water.",

Given that this is the official GE product, I'm very surprised.",

With a new filter it'll run for a couple minutes and shut of for a while, continuing this cycle. When they start to go bad, the humidifier runs constantly. Well this filter worked all of about 2 weeks. Not only is my humidifier running constantly now with this one bad already, this one STINKS when it goes bad.\nSpend the extra couple dollars and get the version with 'aluminum reinforcement', not this black one. The other version lasted at least 2 months for me.",
        "This nearly new dishwasher failed in a spectacular array of flashing lights and gut-wrenching sounds.  We nick named it our little 'Cylon' as it became more than an appliance, it became our house-hold, stainless steel nemesis.  The dishwasher would come to life on its own and would refuse to turn off until we literally pulled the plug.  Amusing to watch our kitten's reaction to the demonic Cylon, but there are more inexpensive forms of entertainment.  Fortunately, mine was covered by a warranty, but after $800 of repairs, the repairmen (several tried) and insurer gave up and our 'Toaster' is now probably enjoying its second life as an automobile bumper.",

I used it all this past winter, and I got mixed results with its ability to prolong the pad's life. Then I began to notice chest pains off and on, but only brief twinges of pain. Nothing lasting. After weeks of it I began to get a little concerned that it was something more serious than just lung irritation. I started to think the worst, but I wasn't completely convinced it wasn't allergies.\n\nI decided to experiment, so I discontinued using this water treatment and ...the pains immediately went away. This is not a scientific investigation, just a case of cause and effect. After researching the problem, I discovered that I am not alone. Others have reported chest pains with this product. My opinion is that if it is causing chest pain, it is something to be avoided at all costs.",

I could get one end to slide on snuggly, but then when I would stretch out the hose to attach the other end the first end would slide off.  I was only trying to stretch the hose about 2 feet to make the connection but the hose is very rigid and pulled the first end off.  The plastic ends also have a thin rubber-like gasket in them that slid up into the hose as I slid them onto the dryer or wall attachments.  I got frustrated and ended up tearing the plastic adapters off and attaching the hose directly to the dryer and wall with the help of tape. This product is not what I had hoped for and I do not recommend this product.",

For the money and the chance for the odd lemon I figured it was worth a revisit, so I bought my second one a month or so ago.  This one has broken as well.  I tried defrosting the thing but it pushed out one more set of ice then died again.  So to summarize, the first one died after twelve months, and the second one died after a month.  Luckily I took the $5 extended warranty.  I am about to find out of the seller will honor it.  I will return with what comes from this, good or bad.",

If you Google \"melting oven knobs GE oven\" you will see there are many people having this problem with this particular model. The heat escaping from the oven door is too much, and it will peel the 'false stainless steel' coating off of the plastic knobs. Basically the fake stainless separates from the underlying plastic knob and bubbles up/peels off over time.\n\nThey won't cover it under warranty. They told me that I could purchase the replacements ($16 each, same knobs as the ones that are already having the issue). Stainless steel after-market ones which do not melt/peel were upwards of $45 each.\n\nClearly a quality issue with manufacturing given the volume of people having this issue.\n\nPOOR Service POOR quality.",

I don't usually write reviews but I'll make any exception for these filters. The filter price doubled in stores, I still buy from Amazon but filters are the same crap. They shred and begin to fall apart in two to three weeks. They actually pull apart.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR BUY A COOL MIST HUMIDIFIER.

        "I don't know what's wrong with these, but they need changed every few days, they will not wick the water!! I'd rather pay a little more & get the better ones. Bought a case of these last year & they lasted no time. Very disappointed!!",
        "I got this item because it was supposedly quiet and powerful. It was very quiet at low speed and Ok at high speed, but I noticed that it had a little vibration at high speed - no biggie. As time went on it got louder and louder. Looks like the fan was never really balanced. It is incredibly loud now! Of course, it only got really bad after the return window had expired!. To make matters worse, the clip tabs for the grill in front are incredibly puny and snapped the first time I removed it, I can't believe I spent $100 on this and feel that I should be able to return it. No one else had this problem so I probably just got a bad one.",
        "We've owned this dishwasher for one year. Four repair calls so far . . . one of those repairs was an installation error, so that's forgivable. But the other three were for leaks that caused the instrument panel to flash, with all lights blinking. The \"all lights blinking\" error is so common for this Electrolux dishwasher (just check the Internet) that, ta-da, it's part of the lore of the model. If you buy one, beware--you will likely undergo the same issue. Luckily we bought the extended four-year warranty or we'd be up a leaky dishwasher creek without a paddle. So every few months, it happens again, we call the repair service, they come and fix it, it works a few more months, ad nauseum. Whatever is up with this model, Electrolux needs to do better or they will face a class-action lawsuit. We paid $1000 for this defective dishwasher. Sadly, when the machine is working, I love it--it cleans effectively, it's whisper quiet, it's an EnergySaver, and it has a ton of features. C'mon, Electrolux--all that engineering you put into designing the thing and you neglect to make it leak-resistant? For shame.",

My Bosch dishwasher is very, very quiet because it hardly ever works. In the past 3 years, I have had to replace the Electronic Control Unit at about $130 a pop. Yesterday it pooped out again. I'm going to buy a new dishwasher rather than fix the bosch again. Bosch is completely unreliable. It is the most unreliable thing I own! I will NEVER buy a Bosch again.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Bosch is the Control Unit. Other problems include heater malfunction and the water inlet valve malfunctions. I have NEVER been so disappointed with any purchase as I am with the Bosch. For those of you who purchased a Bosch, and those of you who plan to purchase a bosch, you will want to keep [...] in your favorites.\n\nGood Luck!",
        "I'm not sure how Amazon can continue to sell an item where so many customers do not receive the item pictured. I too received a filter with no blue pre-filter.  At first I assumed it wouldn't make that much of a difference, but after two weeks this filter is already growing mold. This seems like a significant health risk. I used the filter that came with my himidifier all Winter last year with no mold (had a blue pre-filter). I tossed it at the end of the season as the humidifier suggested. I never would have done so had I known that it would be impossible to replace that filter with an identical filter. They do not seem to be available at all anymore, even directly from the manufacturer. I never would have purchased that humidifier if I had known I would never be able to find quality replacement filters.\n\nThis did appear to be a genuine Honeywell replacement filter. It's just not the same as the one that came with my original humidifier. Not worth the money. Waste of time, effort, and money. I cannot afford to spend 15 bucks on a new filter every two weeks. I do NOT recommend this product.",

OK, I'm not expecting these to be indestructible, and it was my mistake, but for a product that is intended to sit on stovetops, I was quite surprised by how flammable the painted surface is.

It is definitely quieter but it does not grind up food well (e.g. the brown papery skin that is found on onions or the center of bell peppers).  And even worse than this, our sink started stinking a few months after switching to this disposer.  I guess it's the rotting food in the base.  I've tried running whole containers of ice through it as well as baking soda. Unfortunately, a garbage disposer isn't easy to return because you'd have to pay for a service call for the plumber to uninstall it and then to install a new one.

Our washer is 18 months old and has been repeatedly faulting with the error codes, not turning on at all, and the latest is faulting F70 and locking the clothes inside.  I found the online help to get the door open.  For those of you needing to manually get the door open, remove the bottom panel (3 7mm nut-head screws) and reach up on the right side of the door.  There is a grey release tab if pulled downward will open the door.\n\nBack to the washer problems. A local repair service from the company we purchased the machine from refused to work on it, saying that we will have to have the whirlpool service company come do it.  He says these error codes refer to faulty circuit boards and the repair bill is usually at least $600 and people get very angry with him when they find this out and he just won't do it anymore.\n\nI am disappointed to see so many people reporting this problem and getting no response from Whirlpool. This purchase is alot of money for average people and I am appalled at having to repace a $900 washer in less than 2 years after buying it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Whirlpool Duet washers or dryers to anyone.

        "The new and improved filters IMHO is more about cost savings than a better filter.  The new improved all white filters without the outer blue lining protec are junk.\n\nThe outer blue lining not only added the Antimicrobial Treatment but it strengthened the filter.  The outside weave on the new filter is larger and does not hold together as well.  On the previous model the Protec lining was much tighter/smaller helping to trap more dust and strengthen the integrity of the filter.  I had no issues with moisture flow from the blue lined filters.  None of the tips i.e. flipping when refilling tanks, completely rewetting every few days, etc do anything to prolong the life of the new filters.\n\nI am on my second season.  Last season replaced the blue filters twice.  This season I was barely getting 2 weeks with the all new greatly improved, aka junk, filters.\n\nI emailed numerous online vendors in hopes they had inventory of the blue lined filters.  No dice.  But luckily I found salvation on Ebay.  I have now greedily stockpiled over 10 of the previous blue filters and at a lower cost to new improved filters.  This should last me a few years.  I hope by then the bean counters at Honeywell realize their mistake and revert to the previous model.  One can hope.  Until then avoid the new improved filters.  They are useless.

I use the humidifier all the time so the filter has to be wet all the time. I was told that since I purchased the filter from Amazon to return it to them. Which didn't seem right to me since it is their product that is faulty. I contacted Amazon who sent me another filter and it too is on the verge of falling apart. I chose this filter because of the Honeywell name, but they do not stand behind this product which is disappointing.

The fan is positioned in the worst possible place - in the middle at the very back of the unit - the only steam, smoke, etc. it could catch would have to come from the control panel of the stove - where there are no burners. As it is now, steam from boiling pots just go over the front edge of the hood and up to the cabinet doors, where it condenses and runs down them, over the hood and back onto the stove; or it gathers under the hood, condenses and runs down the wall behind the stove. Now I regret replacing the other unit. Don't bother with this model unless you have some bizarre stove that has one burner, right in the middle of the very back of the cooktop.",

I used the filter that came with my himidifier all Winter last year with no mold (had a blue pre-filter). I tossed it at the end of the season as the humidifier suggested. I never would have done so had I known that it would be impossible to replace that filter with an identical filter.

I never would have purchased that humidifier if I had known I would never be able to find quality replacement filters.\n\nThis did appear to be a genuine Honeywell replacement filter.

From the start we had issues with the bottom drawer locking shot when in use...not great if you are trying to get something out before it burns.  Now the entire circuit board is gone in the range.  We did not get the extended warranty and now we cannot use the range.  It has an E15 error code.  The oven works, but you would have to listen to the continuous beeping of the E15 code while using.  Our certified Electrolux guy came out today and said the part is $428 plus the service call of $69.99 and then another charge to install this part.  There is no guarantee it won't happen again.  I can spend the money on the repair by a certified Electrolux technician and then purchase a $400+ warranty from Electrolux to get another 3 years of coverage...then what?

The original clutch band with 3 last 10 years.  I was tempted to go with 6 next time, but ultimately decided to just get a quality 3 band like the one that shipped with the original washer.\n\nIn retrospect, I saved $30 on this one the first.

With a new filter it'll run for a couple minutes and shut of for a while, continuing this cycle. When they start to go bad, the humidifier runs constantly. Well this filter worked all of about 2 weeks.

I could get one end to slide on snuggly, but then when I would stretch out the hose to attach the other end the first end would slide off.  I was only trying to stretch the hose about 2 feet to make the connection but the hose is very rigid and pulled the first end off.  The plastic ends also have a thin rubber-like gasket in them that slid up into the hose as I slid them onto the dryer or wall attachments.  I got frustrated and ended up tearing the plastic adapters off and attaching the hose directly to the dryer and wall with the help of tape.

            "The new and improved filters IMHO is more about cost savings than a better filter.  The new improved all white filters without the outer blue lining protec are junk.\n\nThe outer blue lining not only added the Antimicrobial Treatment but it strengthened the filter.  The outside weave on the new filter is larger and does not hold together as well.  On the previous model the Protec lining was much tighter/smaller helping to trap more dust and strengthen the integrity of the filter.  I had no issues with moisture flow from the blue lined filters.  None of the tips i.e. flipping when refilling tanks, completely rewetting every few days, etc do anything to prolong the life of the new filters.\n\nI am on my second season.  Last season replaced the blue filters twice.  This season I was barely getting 2 weeks with the all new greatly improved, aka junk, filters.\n\nI emailed numerous online vendors in hopes they had inventory of the blue lined filters.  No dice.  But luckily I found salvation on Ebay.  I have now greedily stockpiled over 10 of the previous blue filters and at a lower cost to new improved filters.  This should last me a few years.  I hope by then the bean counters at Honeywell realize their mistake and revert to the previous model.  One can hope.  Until then avoid the new improved filters.  They are useless.  It's a shame because the humidifier is great.",
            "If I could give this product zero stars I would. After 1 week of use it fell apart where it joins at the side seam. When I contacted customer service for the product (Kaz, not Amazon) I was told it fell apart because I kept it wet all the time. What? It's a humidifier filter, it has to be wet to work. I use the humidifier all the time so the filter has to be wet all the time. I was told that since I purchased the filter from Amazon to return it to them. Which didn't seem right to me since it is their product that is faulty. I contacted Amazon who sent me another filter and it too is on the verge of falling apart. I chose this filter because of the Honeywell name, but they do not stand behind this product which is disappointing. I have since bought another brand, Best Air HW14, (https://www.amazon.com/BestAir-HW14-Honeywell-Replacement-Humidifier/dp/B004EZT38M) and it is far superior to this item.

I found the online help to get the door open.  For those of you needing to manually get the door open, remove the bottom panel (3 7mm nut-head screws) and reach up on the right side of the door.  There is a grey release tab if pulled downward will open the door.\n\nBack to the washer problems. A local repair service from the company we purchased the machine from refused to work on it, saying that we will have to have the whirlpool service company come do it.  He says these error codes refer to faulty circuit boards and the repair bill is usually at least $600 and people get very angry with him when they find this out and he just won't do it anymore.\n\nI am disappointed to see so many people reporting this problem and getting no response from Whirlpool. This purchase is alot of money for average people and I am appalled at having to repace a $900 washer in less than 2 years after buying it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Whirlpool Duet washers or dryers to anyone.  We will never buy another Whirlpool product from this day forward.",
            "I have purchased two of these units and both stopped working after about a year of service. Both units were only used during the week and run solely on distilled water and shut off and drained after each use. The first unit the circuit board went out and the second the cooling arm stopped working. I contacted customer support which told me the steps to \"reset\" my machine which didn't resolve the problem. My unit was 10 days past warranty and they declined further support. The machine works but in my experience it's a one year lifespan. I'd go with another option.",
            "As others have stated here, this unit apparently LOVES to die out less than 2 years. A year and 3-4 months in my case.\n\nI actually bought TWO of these back in Dec 2016, one for me and one as a Christmas gift for my mom.\n\nA few weeks ago, she called me to tell me her freezer went out without warning and she lost all her food.\n\nI was looking into possibly getting it repaired or replaced when, all of a sudden, my unit went out yesterday!\n\nIt's insane that soo many other people are having the same exact issue. I will NEVER buy from Igloo again.",
            "If I could give this product zero stars I would. After 1 week of use it fell apart where it joins at the side seam. When I contacted customer service for the product (Kaz, not Amazon) I was told it fell apart because I kept it wet all the time. What? It's a humidifier filter, it has to be wet to work. I use the humidifier all the time so the filter has to be wet all the time. I was told that since I purchased the filter from Amazon to return it to them. Which didn't seem right to me since it is their product that is faulty. I contacted Amazon who sent me another filter and it too is on the verge of falling apart. I chose this filter because of the Honeywell name, but they do not stand behind this product which is disappointing. I have since bought another brand, Best Air HW14, (https://www.amazon.com/BestAir-HW14-Honeywell-Replacement-Humidifier/dp/B004EZT38M) and it is far superior to this item. Photos are 1: filter after 1 week of use, 2 & 3: New filter showing poor quality of side seam and how it is only glued together on the outside edge of filter",
            "My Mother bought 3 of us this ice maker for gifts and within 6 months they all died.  I contacted Emerson and their customer service department has a care less attitude and pretty much said tough luck.  Stay away from this machine!"

I contacted Whirlpool who sent out a tech to check it out and after a $87.00 call out fee the tech said it would be cheaper to buy another dishwasher than to fix this one (had a bad circuit board and touch panel). He also said when I buy another dishwasher look for one that has more than a 1 year warranty without having to buy an extended warranty so basically he said not to buy a whirlpool because they only offer a 1 year warranty as a standard warranty.

It pulls and stretches your clothes, and makes everything a wrinkled ball. I can not state what a piece of junk this truely is.

Oh, its not fine! i even showed the tech the clothes...he shaked his head and he said his hands are tied.\nit was not fine the first week i bought it, and ABC Warehouse or the company does not care. I am stuck until i can afford another, and then i will feel too guilty about selling it to somebody else-but then what,-sell a $700 washer for scrap metal?\nOH yea....the extra huge large capacity is a farce..you try filling this bomb up and all it does is wrinkle your clothes and shoots water on it here and there, and leaves soap residue all over.

I use the humidifier all the time so the filter has to be wet all the time. I was told that since I purchased the filter from Amazon to return it to them. Which didn't seem right to me since it is their product that is faulty. I contacted Amazon who sent me another filter and it too is on the verge of falling apart. I chose this filter because of the Honeywell name, but they do not stand behind this product which is disappointing. I have since bought another brand, Best Air HW14, (https://www.amazon.com/BestAir-HW14-Honeywell-Replacement-Humidifier/dp/B004EZT38M) and it is far superior to this item.

After a couple of weeks Danby decided they would refund our money.  It is 2 months later and our check is in the mail (somewhere).\n\nI would not recommend this unit to anyone.

The fan is positioned in the worst possible place - in the middle at the very back of the unit - the only steam, smoke, etc. it could catch would have to come from the control panel of the stove - where there are no burners. As it is now, steam from boiling pots just go over the front edge of the hood and up to the cabinet doors, where it condenses and runs down them, over the hood and back onto the stove; or it gathers under the hood, condenses and runs down the wall behind the stove. Now I regret replacing the other unit. Don't bother with this model unless you have some bizarre stove that has one burner, right in the middle of the very back of the cooktop.",

Woke up one morning with a huge puddle of water, downhill from there. The parts for this fridge over so expensive! One bottom rail in the freeze is $400, PLUS service call price. It is the only french door fridge with the evaporator on the back, which causes additional issues while servicing it bc it takes 2 service techs together to try and fix it.

Sadly, when the machine is working, I love it--it cleans effectively, it's whisper quiet, it's an EnergySaver, and it has a ton of features.

Does not dry the dishes, even when using heat dry.  Leaves a film on the dishes (even with a rinse agent) that ruins your dishes.  Just started leaking today.  I am replacing the dishwasher this week.\n\nFOLLOWUP:  2012-10-10\nI replaced this dishwasher with a KitchenAid with pot-scrubber option.  Half the price, almost as quiet, does a great job cleaning the dishes, has a built in food grinder, leave the dishes dry with no film.  Love it.",
            "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Unlike the original Whirlaway splash guard, this one has leave segments which are far too stiff.  As a result, waste simply does not go down into the disposal unless you force each item through with your fingers.  Absolutely maddening."
